Multidimensional measures of depriva-\\ntion are composed of different indicators fitting into a\\nsyntheticscale[ 9,10],whichisdeemedtoreflectbasic\\nliving standards and the exclusion from the minimum\\nacceptable way of life in one’s own society.\\nIn2010theMultidimensionalPovertyIndex( MPI),was\\nofficiallypublishedbyOxfordPovertyandHumanDevel-\\nopmentInitiative2incollaborationwithHumanDevelop-\\nmentReportOfficeof theUnitedNationsDevelopment\\nProgramme (UNDP) [ 11]. TheMPIconsiders poverty\\nthrough ten indicators divided into three dimensions:\\nhealth,educationandstandardofliving. Thedimensions\\nare equally weighted, and so are the specific indicators.\\nSeveral methodologies to assess poverty from a multi-\\ndimensionalperspectiveexist,includingmethodsaiming\\nto implement aggregate data from different sources, and\\nstatisticalapproaches– i.e.,principalcomponentanalysis,\\norclusteranalysis–whichreflectthejointdistribution\\nof single deprivation indicators and aim for a bottom-up\\ndefinitionofsyntheticscales[ 12].

Matrix 𝑌is thus mapped into a deprivation ma-\\ntrix𝐺 = [𝐺𝑘𝑗]ofvaluesbelongingtotherange [0,1],with\\nbinary values associated to categorical features obtained\\napplyingproperthresholdsandcontinuousrealvalues\\nfor numeric ones.

Background\\nPopulations in OECDcountries are ageing rapidly, their\\nhealth worsens, and they may struggle with everyday\\nactivities.

However,\\nincome-basedindicatorsarepoorproxiesofmaterialcon-\\nditionsamongtheelderly[ 5,6]whereasnon-monetary\\nonesimproveourunderstandingofwhoispoor,witha\\nshift from a unidimensional to a multidimensional ap-\\nproach [7],[8]. Multidimensional measures of depriva-\\ntion are composed of different indicators fitting into a\\nsyntheticscale[ 9,10],whichisdeemedtoreflectbasic\\nliving standards and the exclusion from the minimum\\nacceptable way of life in one’s own society.\\nIn2010theMultidimensionalPovertyIndex( MPI),was\\nofficiallypublishedbyOxfordPovertyandHumanDevel-\\nopmentInitiative2incollaborationwithHumanDevelop-\\nmentReportOfficeof theUnitedNationsDevelopment\\nProgramme (UNDP) [ 11]. TheMPIconsiders poverty\\nthrough ten indicators divided into three dimensions:\\nhealth,educationandstandardofliving. Thedimensions\\nare equally weighted, and so are the specific indicators.\\nSeveral methodologies to assess poverty from a multi-\\ndimensionalperspectiveexist,includingmethodsaiming\\nto implement aggregate data from different sources, and\\nstatisticalapproaches– i.e.,principalcomponentanalysis,\\norclusteranalysis–whichreflectthejointdistribution\\nof single deprivation indicators and aim for a bottom-up\\ndefinitionofsyntheticscales[ 12].

Matrix 𝑌is thus mapped into a deprivation ma-\\ntrix𝐺 = [𝐺𝑘𝑗]ofvaluesbelongingtotherange [0,1],with\\nbinary values associated to categorical features obtained\\napplyingproperthresholdsandcontinuousrealvalues\\nfor numeric ones.

Background Populations in OECDcountries are ageing rapidly, their health worsens, and they may struggle with everyday activities. The financial challenges faced by older people with Long-Term Care ( LTC) needs can be very high and absorb a significant amount of their income. Home care andsmallout-of-pocketpaymentsmaybeunaffordable without adequate social protection. Most studies emphasize the economic facet of poverty on the basis of monetary income [ 2,3,4]. However, income-basedindicatorsarepoorproxiesofmaterialcon- ditionsamongtheelderly[ 5,6]whereasnon-monetary onesimproveourunderstandingofwhoispoor,witha shift from a unidimensional to a multidimensional ap- proach [7],[8]. Multidimensional measures of depriva- tion are composed of different indicators fitting into a syntheticscale[ 9,10],whichisdeemedtoreflectbasic living standards and the exclusion from the minimum acceptable way of life in one’s own society. In2010theMultidimensionalPovertyIndex( MPI),was officiallypublishedbyOxfordPovertyandHumanDevel- opmentInitiative2incollaborationwithHumanDevelop- mentReportOfficeof theUnitedNationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) [ 11]. TheMPIconsiders poverty through ten indicators divided into three dimensions: health,educationandstandardofliving. Thedimensions are equally weighted, and so are the specific indicators. Several methodologies to assess poverty from a multi- dimensionalperspectiveexist,includingmethodsaiming to implement aggregate data from different sources, and statisticalapproaches– i.e.,principalcomponentanalysis, orclusteranalysis–whichreflectthejointdistribution of single deprivation indicators and aim for a bottom-up definitionofsyntheticscales[ 12]. Suchapproachesare adequate if they capture the joint distribution of depri- vations, identify the poor ones ( i.e., dichotomising the populationintopoorandnon-poor),andprovideasingle cardinal figure to assess poverty. Onlyrecently,thankstobigdataavailabilityandthe developmentofdatasciencetechniques, MLandAIhave been increasinglyadopted to povertyestimation. More- over,theCOVID-19pandemicledtoasignificantincrease inextremeglobalpovertywithrespecttothelast20years, 2ophi.org.ukaccordingtoreportspublishedbytheWorldBank[ 13], increasing the effort in defining predictive models. Besides the choice of the best algorithms, other cru- cial aspects, such as data quality and the presence of bias due to subjective and indirectly related data, exist, pushingtochoosingotherdatasourcessuchasremote sensingdatasets[ 14]. Asecondissueisrelatedtothedif- ficulties in finding labelled data. Ensemble models were employed, assuming as ground truth for MLtraining the Proxy Means Test ( PMT) labels, without verifying the accuracy of the PMTlabels [15]. Among different ML techniquesforpovertyclassification,decisiontree[ 16], random forest [ 15], and ensemble approaches [ 17] are the most used. 3. Dataset Theapproachpresentedherereliesonthe TAPASdataset (Time and Places and Space in Aging dataset)[ 18], pre- viously collected by Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neuro- logicoCarloBesta3andAuserLombardy4,bothcurrently involvedinthe AMPELproject5. Tocollectthedataset,a setofvalidatedtoolspreviouslydevelopedandusedin two projects [ 19,20] was administered to older people by trained interviewers to investigate various aspects of health, environment, social networks, and quality of life, resulting in a total of 744features (or variables) for each individual. The questionnaires were administered to 429 people aged 50or over. The features can be grouped into three categories:i) Categorical Features: variables which assume a fixed rangeofvalues( e.g.,privatehealthinsurancecoverage: yes or no); ii) Numeric Features: variables which assume numeric values, both discrete and continue ( e.g., heart rate: 84);andiii)RangeFeatures: variableswhichassume range values, ( e.g., ages: 60-75).

The AMPEL approach TAPASrepresents an excellent dataset to investigate poverty from a multidimensional perspective, thanks to thelargenumberoffeaturesusedtodescribeeachindi- vidual.

Background\\nPopulations in OECDcountries are ageing rapidly, their\\nhealth worsens, and they may struggle with everyday\\nactivities. The financial challenges faced by older people\\nwith Long-Term Care ( LTC) needs can be very high and\\nabsorb a significant amount of their income. Home care\\nandsmallout-of-pocketpaymentsmaybeunaffordable\\nwithout adequate social protection.\\nMost studies emphasize the economic facet of poverty\\non the basis of monetary income [ 2,3,4]. However,\\nincome-basedindicatorsarepoorproxiesofmaterialcon-\\nditionsamongtheelderly[ 5,6]whereasnon-monetary\\nonesimproveourunderstandingofwhoispoor,witha\\nshift from a unidimensional to a multidimensional ap-\\nproach [7],[8]. Multidimensional measures of depriva-\\ntion are composed of different indicators fitting into a\\nsyntheticscale[ 9,10],whichisdeemedtoreflectbasic\\nliving standards and the exclusion from the minimum\\nacceptable way of life in one’s own society.\\nIn2010theMultidimensionalPovertyIndex( MPI),was\\nofficiallypublishedbyOxfordPovertyandHumanDevel-\\nopmentInitiative2incollaborationwithHumanDevelop-\\nmentReportOfficeof theUnitedNationsDevelopment\\nProgramme (UNDP) [ 11]. TheMPIconsiders poverty\\nthrough ten indicators divided into three dimensions:\\nhealth,educationandstandardofliving. Thedimensions\\nare equally weighted, and so are the specific indicators.\\nSeveral methodologies to assess poverty from a multi-\\ndimensionalperspectiveexist,includingmethodsaiming\\nto implement aggregate data from different sources, and\\nstatisticalapproaches– i.e.,principalcomponentanalysis,\\norclusteranalysis–whichreflectthejointdistribution\\nof single deprivation indicators and aim for a bottom-up\\ndefinitionofsyntheticscales[ 12]. Suchapproachesare\\nadequate if they capture the joint distribution of depri-\\nvations, identify the poor ones ( i.e., dichotomising the\\npopulationintopoorandnon-poor),andprovideasingle\\ncardinal figure to assess poverty.\\nOnlyrecently,thankstobigdataavailabilityandthe\\ndevelopmentofdatasciencetechniques, MLandAIhave\\nbeen increasinglyadopted to povertyestimation.

Asecondissueisrelatedtothedif-\\nficulties in finding labelled data. Ensemble models were\\nemployed, assuming as ground truth for MLtraining the\\nProxy Means Test ( PMT) labels, without verifying the\\naccuracy of the PMTlabels [15]. Among different ML\\ntechniquesforpovertyclassification,decisiontree[ 16],\\nrandom forest [ 15], and ensemble approaches [ 17] are\\nthe most used.\\n3.

The questionnaires were administered to 429\\npeople aged 50or over.\\nThe features can be grouped into three categories:i)\\nCategorical Features: variables which assume a fixed\\nrangeofvalues( e.g.,privatehealthinsurancecoverage:\\nyes or no); ii) Numeric Features: variables which assume\\nnumeric values, both discrete and continue ( e.g., heart\\nrate: 84);andiii)RangeFeatures: variableswhichassume\\nrange values, ( e.g., ages: 60-75).\\nFor more details about the dataset please refer to [ 18].\\n4.

These weights make it possible to label\\nthe individuals in the dataset according to the degree of\\npoverty: i) high, ii) medium or iii) low.\\nThe method starts by considering the initial dataset,\\nas a𝑛-by-𝑝matrix𝑌 = [𝑌𝑘𝑗], where𝑛is the number of\\nindividuals (n=429) and 𝑝the size of the selected feature\\nvector (p=99).\\nEach row of the matrix 𝑦𝑘= (𝑌𝑘1,...,𝑌𝑘𝑗,...,𝑌𝑘𝑝)gives\\nthe features of the 𝑘-th individual, while each column\\n𝑦𝑗= (𝑌1𝑗,...,𝑌𝑘𝑗,...,𝑌𝑛𝑗)gives the distribution of the 𝑗-th\\nfeature across individuals.\\nIt is important to note that the values of the 𝑌ma-\\ntrix are heterogeneous and can be ordinal, binary, or\\nnumeric. Matrix 𝑌is thus mapped into a deprivation ma-\\ntrix𝐺 = [𝐺𝑘𝑗]ofvaluesbelongingtotherange [0,1],with\\nbinary values associated to categorical features obtained\\napplyingproperthresholdsandcontinuousrealvalues\\nfor numeric ones. The mapping rules have been defined\\nby the domain expert. This expert knowledge permits todefine for each feature its deprivation level. An example\\nof this mapping is reported below.\\nFrom𝐺, summingovertherows,itispossibletocal-\\nculate a deprivation score 𝑐 = (𝑐1,...,𝑐𝑘,...,𝑐𝑛)for each\\nindividual. Thescorerepresentsthepovertyassociated\\nto each individual, so the higher the score, the more\\ndeprived the individual will be. However to better repro-\\nduce the reality, a vector 𝑣 = (𝑣1,...,𝑣𝑗,...,𝑣𝑝)of weights\\nshould be defined to properly consider the contribution\\nof each feature, where ∑𝑝\\n𝑗=1𝑣𝑗= 1and0 ≤ 𝑣𝑗≤ 1.\\nThusthe deprivation score 𝑐is obtained as:\\n𝑐 = 𝐺 ×𝑣⊤(1)\\nInsteadofdefiningasinglevectorofweights,following\\nLiberatietal.

This research uses Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) in a \\nfield database of 1654 over-indebted households to identify distinguishable clusters and to predict its risk factors. \\nFirst, unsupervised machine learning using Self-Organizing Maps generated three over-indebtedness clusters: \\nlow-income (31.27%), low credit control (37.40%), and crisis-affected households (31.33%). Second, supervised \\nmachine learning with exhaustive grid search hyperparameters (32,730 predictive models) suggests that Nu- \\nSupport Vector Machine had the best accuracy in predicting families ’ over-indebtedness risk factors (89.5%). \\nBy proposing an AutoML approach on over-indebtedness, our research adds both theoretically and methodo -\\nlogically to current models of scarcity with important practical implications for business research and society. \\nOur findings also contribute to novel ways to identify and characterize poverty risk in earlier stages, allowing \\ncustomized interventions for different profiles of over-indebtedness.   \\n1.Introduction \\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), more than 780 million people \\n(about 11% of the world ’s population) live below the international \\npoverty line (United Nations, 2019a ). While this percentage represents a \\nsignificant decline in extreme poverty from past decades, the number of \\npoor families globally remains unacceptably high (Njuguna & McSharry, \\n2017 ). It is thus not surprising that for the United Nations 2030 Agenda \\nfor Sustainable Development, ending “poverty in all its forms every -\\nwhere by 2030 ” is the first global challenge in terms of sustainable \\ndevelopment goals (United Nations, 2019b ). \\nMost of the research and public policy about poverty highlights \\nemerging and least developed countries (e.g., Africa, Latin America; for \\na review see Njuguna & McSharry, 2017 ). Less attention has been given \\nto localized deprivation of extreme poverty within developed countries (Shaefer & Edin, 2013 ) and to over-indebtedness as a major factor of \\npoverty due to severe economic austerity in these countries. Such factors \\ncan considerably foster clusters of scarcity in more fragile developed \\ncountries, sharing features comparable to those of underdeveloped \\ncountries. \\nThe current research focuses on over-indebtedness (i.e., the recurrent \\nincapability to repaying credits when they are due) and its risk factors \\namong Portuguese households in the aftermath of the European sover -\\neign debt crisis. As a result of this crisis, Portuguese society was besieged \\nby severe austerity due to so-called collective overspending (e.g., Panico \\n& Purificato, 2013 ). According to the Organization for Economic Co- \\noperation and Development (OECD), by 2014, Portugal was character -\\nized by a poverty rate significantly higher than the European average \\n(Arnold & Rodrigues, 2015 ) with more than 2.6 million people living at \\nrisk of poverty (Statistics Portugal, 2017 ).

Research aimed at \\ntesting such accounts have indeed linked many of these risk factors to \\nover-indebtedness. However, most studies have provided evidence for \\nthe causal role of each of these factors “ceteris paribus ” (i.e., assuming \\nthat all the remaining factors are held constant); however, actual cases \\nof over-indebted households are likely to be multifactorial. Remarkably, \\nhow different risk factors combine in producing concrete situations of \\nover-indebtedness is a highly important issue to the goal of ending \\npoverty that has received less research attention. \\nIn sum, our approach asserts that over-indebtedness is a multifaceted \\nconcept that does not speak with one voice. Rather, it embraces different \\nkinds of over-indebted consumers, each one presenting a different pro-\\nfile and hence a different configuration of risk factors. The independent \\ncontribution to the over-indebtedness of each of these factors has \\nalready been established by previous business and psychology research \\nas we review in more detail later. However, they are usually treated \\nindependently from each other rather than in interaction with each \\nother. \\nHere, we address and evaluate the existence of different profiles of \\nover-indebtedness by looking for distinguishable clusters or combina -\\ntions of characteristics (based on household biographical and financial \\ndata) that would allow us to categorize over-indebted consumers in an \\nexhaustive and mutually exclusive way. For this, we investigate a large \\nfield data set of over-indebted households who contacted the debt \\nadvisory services of the Portuguese Association for the Consumer De-\\nfense (DECO Portugal). Given the extension and complexity of the data \\nset, we used artificial intelligence (AI) to look for distinguishable clus-\\nters or combinations of features that would allow us to classify and \\npredict consumers ’ over-indebtedness. \\nArtificial intelligence is a term commonly used to describe the ability \\nbestowed on digital computers, or computer-controlled systems, to \\naccomplish tasks like intelligent beings (Nilsson, 2014 ). We resorted to a \\nparticular sub-area of AI, called Machine Learning (ML) (Marsland, \\n2015 ) to autonomously extract patterns from over-indebtedness data. \\nSpecifically, we employed Automated Machine Learning (AutoML; \\nFeurer et al., 2015 ), which enabled us the evaluate thousands of models \\ngenerated by state-of-the-art algorithms with multiple combinations of \\nparametrization, and different types of feature selection methods. \\nAutoML outperforms traditional ML approaches, allowing for a more \\nsubstantial contribution of the present work to business research. \\nWe begin by briefly reviewing prior business and psychological ac-\\ncounts of consumers ’ use of credit and discuss several risk factors of \\nover-indebtedness. Next, we present a systematic review of the literature \\non artificial intelligence and machine learning to show the relatively \\nscant use of these important methods in the realm of business research. \\nThe current machine learning approach specifically aimed at describing \\nand predicting different profiles of over-indebtedness is then presented \\nand empirically tested. Our ultimate goal is to contribute to the devel -\\nopment of predictive models that can help practitioners and public \\npolicy makers to make better interventions regarding economic de-\\ncisions and contribute to reducing poverty risk at earlier stages. \\n2.Credit use and over-indebtedness \\nEconomic theories of consumption such as the life cycle hypothesis \\npurpose that people take on debt based on expected future income when \\nthey are young and then save during middle age to maintain con-\\nsumption level later in life (Modigliani, 1966 ). In practice, many con-\\nsumers seem to deviate from these theoretical predictions when it comes to borrowing and saving. Indeed, along the 20th century, consumers \\nhave been gradually more open to the idea of using credit as a way of \\nobtaining liquidity that their pay-checks would not otherwise permit \\n(Watkins, 2000 ) as a way to promote their financial well-being (Brüg-\\ngen, Hogreve, Holmlund, Kabadayi, & L¨ofgren, 2017 ). \\nTogether with more extensive use of credit came a shift in how \\nconsumers react to debt. The idea of being in debt has become pro-\\ngressively less dreaded and more normalized. Nowadays, it is often \\nperceived as an inherent condition shared by many of us in the process of \\nobtaining necessary goods and services, such as a place to live or getting \\na college degree (Celsi, Nelson, Dellande, & Gilly, 2017; Merskin, 1998 ). \\nFollowing this tendency, most Western societies reported over the last \\nfew decades an increase in consumer credit use and household debt \\nlevels (e.g., Betti, Dourmashkin, Rossi, & Yin, 2007; Brown, Garino, \\nTaylor, & Price, 2005; Kida, 2009; Pattarin & Cosma, 2012 ). \\nDebt turns out to be troublesome to individuals and governments \\nalike when it reaches such high levels that households become over- \\nindebted. Over-indebtedness may be defined as recurrent incapability \\nto repaying credits when they are due, sometimes self-reported, some -\\ntimes calculated from economic information from the household (e.g., a \\nhigh debt-to-income ratio). As such over-indebtedness is related to the \\nmore overarching concept of scarcity, usually defined as a condition of \\nhaving insufficient resources to cope with financial demands (Zhao & \\nTomm, 2018 ). \\nBeing over-indebted has a profound impact in households, leading to \\nincreased risk of deprivation and poverty and consequent social stigma, \\ndeteriorated health and well-being, relationship difficulties and break -\\ndown, financial exclusion, and reduced labor market activity (Alleweldt, \\nKara, Graham, Kempson, Collard, Stamp, & Nahtigal, 2013 ). Although \\nsome studies have found that households with lower incomes are more \\nprone to have difficulties repaying their debts (Aizcorbe, Kennickell, & \\nMoore, 2003; Sullivan & Fisher, 1988 ); other studies found no evidence \\nof such relation (Betti et al., 2007; Canner & Luckett, 1991 ), which \\nsuggests that while low income may increase households ’ risk of over- \\nindebtedness, being over-indebted is not a situation exclusive to low \\nsocioeconomic status households. \\n2.1. Risk factors of over-indebtedness \\nOver-indebtedness has been related to several possible causes or risk \\nfactors. One is poor financial literacy due to a lack of appropriate formal \\neducation. Consumers ’ lack of knowledge concerning financial products \\nand concepts make households vulnerable to debt repayment diffi-\\nculties. However, although several studies have confirmed the associa -\\ntion between innumeracy, financial illiteracy, and households ’ poor \\nfinancial decision-making (Lusardi & Mitchell, 2011; Lusardi & Tufano, \\n2015 ), there is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of financial educa -\\ntion programs in avoiding decisions potentially leading to over- \\nindebtedness (see Dellande, Gilly, & Graham, 2016; Lusardi, 2008 ). \\nEffects of low financial literacy in accumulation and repayment of \\ndebts are likely to be aggravated by consumers ’ proneness to rely on \\nheuristics when making decisions, which make them the prey of several \\nreasoning biases (e.g., Thaler & Sunstein, 2008 ). For instance, the \\nasymmetrical perception consumers display between present gains and \\nfuture losses encourages the increased use of credit and disregard for the \\naccumulation of interests (Slowik, 2012 ). In the same vein, individuals \\ndisplaying present-bias preferences (i.e., desire for immediate con-\\nsumption) show more tendency of having credit-card debt and higher \\ndebts in credit-cards (Meier & Sprenger, 2010; Str¨omb¨ack, Lind, Ska-\\ngerlund, V¨astfj¨all, & Tingh ¨og, 2017 ). \\nThese (and other) reasoning biases are often explored by financial \\ninstitutions that tailor their communication and product advertisement \\nto turn consumer ’s heuristic-based judgments into their favor, some -\\ntimes leading consumers to bad financial decisions regarding debt \\naccumulation and repayment (Bar-Gill & Warren, 2008 ). However, \\nreliance on heuristic-based judgments seems to be dependent not only M. Boto Ferreira et al.

Specifically, on the ability to second guess, analyze and \\noverride appealing but biased outputs, replacing them with more ac-\\ncurate decisions (Stanovich, 2009; Stanovich & West, 2008; Stanovich, \\nWest, & Toplak, 2011; Toplak, West, & Stanovich, 2017). \\nInterventions based on nudging and disclosure of relevant informa -\\ntion to individual consumers have been successfully developed by \\nbehavioral economics (e.g., Hertwig & Grüne-Yanoff, 2017; Loibl, \\nJones, & Haisley, 2018; Thaler & Sunstein, 2008) as means to promote \\nbetter financial decisions. However, even carefully designed messages \\nmay have only a small impact in counteracting the negative effects of \\nreasoning biases on consumers’ behavior (e.g., Bertrand & Morse, \\n2009). \\nFurthermore, consumers’ self-control and the need to resist impul -\\nsive consumption (e.g., using credit cards), likely depends on the \\navailability of limited and easily depletable cognitive resources (Bau-\\nmeister, Vohs, & Tice, 2007; Inzlicht & Schmeichel, 2012). Limited self- \\ncontrol may work both as a cause and as a consequence of over- \\nindebtedness. On one hand, there is substantial evidence showing in-\\ndividual differences in self-control (e.g., Eigsti et al., 2006; Mischel, \\n1958) suggesting that some people may be more vulnerable to a social \\nenvironment that encourages impulsive consumption than others; on the \\nother hand, previous research also shows that over-indebted households \\nface a spiral of difficult decisions (that other households typically do not \\nface) that result from small budgets requiring the meticulous calculation \\nof expenses and juggling of sporadic incomes. This state of affairs pro-\\ngressively depletes their self-control capacity (e.g., Mani, Mullainathan, \\nShafir, & Zhao, 2013; Vohs & Heatherton, 2000; Zhao & Tomm, 2018). \\nIndeed, the demands caused by over-indebtedness in particular and \\nscarcity in general, tend to hijack the cognitive system depleting \\ncognitive resources, such as attention, working memory, and executive \\ncontrol (Bertrand, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2004). Regardless, the \\ndispositional lack of self-control or its subsequent depletion by circum -\\nstances of severe austerity, impairs consumers’ cognitive capacity \\nshifting decision behavior away from reasoned options towards more \\nintuitive and impulsive choices (Vohs & Faber, 2007). \\nOver-indebtedness has also been related to other more situational \\nrisk factors, such as adverse local circumstances or significant life \\nevents. Younger consumers and more numerous households (especially \\nwith more children) are associated with debt repayment difficulty \\n(Canner & Luckett, 1991; Godwin, 1999), as well as households with \\ndivorced/separated people (Canner & Luckett, 1991). Adverse life \\nevents are reported frequently as a reason for late payments (Canner & \\nLuckett, 1991) and the presence of adverse life events in the last 12 \\nmonths are associated with households with debt repayment strain in \\ncomparison to a control group (Tokunaga, 1993). \\nAbrupt changes in socio-economic conditions can launch (mostly \\nmiddle-class) households into financial strains and increased risk of \\nindebtedness. The European sovereign debt crisis that followed the \\n2008–2009 World economic recession is a case in point. After the bailout \\nof the Portuguese debt in 2010, several austerity measures ensued. There \\nwas a steep increase in taxes for employees and businesses and sub-\\nstantial cuts in the monthly income of public workers and retirement \\npensions. Unemployment soared and social benefits were cut. Such \\nmeasures put together led to a dramatic increase in the financial \\nvulnerability of the Portuguese households (similar scenarios unfolded \\nin Greece, Ireland, and Spain). By the end of 2014, in a population of \\nabout 10 million, 2.6 million were over-indebted (i.e., with a debt-to- \\nincome rate of more than 35%) and 700.000 had entered in default \\n(Bank of Portugal, 2014; Statistics Portugal, 2017. \\nIn the last few years, particularly since 2016, the Portuguese econ-\\nomy has started a slow recovery with all major credit rating agencies \\nmoving Portugal’s debt from junk territory to “stable” or “positive” \\noutlook by 2018. Interestingly, despite the decline in unemployment \\nand the progressive removal of cuts in monthly income, the household \\neffort rate of the Portuguese families increased from 70.8% in 2017 to 73% in the first semester of 2018 (DECO, 2018). This once more suggests \\nthat over-indebtedness is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that \\nneeds to be better understood. \\n2.2. Profiling and predicting over-indebtedness: A machine learning \\napproach \\nMost of the aforementioned research on risk factors underlying over- \\nindebtedness has been done in a top-down manner. Several risk factors \\n(e.g., financial illiteracy, prevalence in the use of improper heuristics, \\nlack of self-control, markers of economic austerity) are related to over- \\nindebted households in some cases, and interventions based on these \\nfactors (e.g., financial education programs, nudging) have shown to be \\nsometimes (but not always) successful in counteracting over- \\nindebtedness. This indicates that the identified factors play an impor -\\ntant role but are not always sufficient conditions for over-indebtedness. \\nActual cases of over-indebtedness are likely to result from different \\ncombinations of risk factors. In this sense, we hypothesize that the \\nnotion of over-indebtedness in itself may be a misnomer because it puts \\nunder the same conceptual umbrella distinct types or profiles of \\nindebted households. However, the degree with which the different \\ncombinations of factors underlying over-indebtedness carve different \\nprofiles of over-indebted households is an empirical question that we \\nbegin to answer in the present work. \\nIn this paper, we suggest a bottom-up approach capable of a) \\nexploring possible different profiles of over-indebted households, and b) \\nidentifying the main features of the profiles (if and when they emerge \\nfrom the data) to develop predictive models of classification of new \\ncases (households) under risk of over-indebtedness. Such a bottom-up \\napproach is methodologically challenging but achievable using artifi-\\ncial intelligence to develop descriptive and predictive models concern -\\ning the risk factors of over-indebtedness of Portuguese consumers. \\nBefore presenting our methodological approach and to contextualize \\nthe research here reported, we first assess prior work using artificial \\nintelligence in business research. \\n3.Artificial intelligence in business research \\nWe conducted a systematic literature review searching several online \\nscientific databases (e.g., EBSCO, Elsevier Science Direct, Emerald, \\nJSTOR, SCIELO, Scopus, and Tailor & Francis) to identify empirical and \\nconceptual studies examining artificial intelligence or machine learning \\nspecifically in business research. \\nWe used the following keywords in the search process, along with \\nbusiness research: machine learning, artificial intelligence, support vector \\nmachines, automated machine learning, and AutoML. After obtaining the \\ninitial set of articles, we applied a snowballing procedure for examining \\nthe references in these articles and find additional studies. The search \\nprocess was completed in May 2020 (see Table 1 for details). We found a \\ntotal of 11 articles in business research directly linked to artificial in-\\ntelligence and/or machine learning. 72.7% were empirical articles and \\n27.3% were conceptual papers. The large majority of the articles \\n(81.8%) analyzed single algorithms (or a single algorithm family) and \\nonly 18.2% of the studies employed multiple algorithms. Finally, none \\nof the business research studies found in this search used automated \\nmachine learning (AutoML). This shows that the employment of Auto-\\nmated Machine Learning (AutoML) to characterize and predict over- \\nindebtedness is still rather new. \\nProbably, the most similar approach to the one here presented was \\nadvanced by Montiel, Bifet, Abdessalem, and (2017). Predicting over- \\nindebtedness on batch and streaming data. Paper presentation ate the, \\n(2017). These authors used feature selection and supervised learning \\ntechniques, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forests to generate \\npredictive models of over-indebtedness. However, several points \\ndistinguish the present work from Montiel et al. (2017). First, Support \\nVector Machines, the supervised machine learning technique used here M. Boto Ferreira et al.

       "  Document(page_content='Journal of Business Research 131 (2021) 411–425\\n414is substantially different from the ones used in Montiel et al. (2017). In \\nour work, we employed state-of-the-art algorithms using Automated \\nMachine Learning (AutoML; Feurer et al., 2015), in which Support \\nVector Machines were able to outperform several alternative algorithms \\nused in business research such as Logistic Regression and Random For-\\nests (on the data at our disposal in a preliminary experimental phase). \\nSecond, descriptive modeling is absent in Montiel et al. (2017), while it \\nis a fundamental part of the present work. Third, Montiel et al. (2017) \\nused data from a banking institution relative to French individuals and \\nhouseholds. This is a noticeable difference since all indicators suggest \\nthat the risk of over-indebtedness and poverty in Portugal is more \\nserious than in France. In addition, our data is originated at a consumer \\nprotection institution, not a bank, which may highlight the societal \\nrelevance of our field dataset. \\nOther less directly related but important research include the use of \\nGradient Boosted Models by Agarwal et al. (2018) to connect financial \\noutcomes and phone-based social behavior to predict financial well-\\nbeing in the US, and the use of various data mining algorithms by Alo-\\nmari (2017) for default prediction of peer-to-peer loans and learning \\nassociations between various attributes of loan applications. It is also \\nworth mentioning the work by Eletter, Yaseen, and Elrefae (2010), \\nwhere Artificial Neural Networks were used for evaluating credit ap-\\nplications to support loan decisions. 4.Methods \\nIn the present work, we use Unsupervised ML algorithms such as Self \\nOrganizing Maps and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to obtain \\ndescriptive models aimed at finding different over-indebtedness con-\\nsumer clusters (corresponding to distinct profiles). Furthermore, we \\nresort to Supervised ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, \\nusing Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) (Feurer et al., 2015) to \\nobtain predictive models aimed at successfully identifying and classi -\\nfying (in different profiles) new cases (households) under risk of over- \\nindebtedness. \\nOur objective is to contribute to preventing over-indebtedness and \\nreduce poverty by proposing artificial intelligence tools that are capable \\nof a more fine-grained characterization of actual cases of over-indebted \\nhouseholds, and that build on this characterization to better assess the \\nrisk of future cases of over-indebtedness. \\nThis section is structured as follows. In section 4.1, we describe the \\nemployed over-indebtedness real-world field data. Section 4.2 presents \\nthe employed ML approach. Section 4.3 shows the system used to \\ngenerate our descriptive model, aimed at producing a clustering of over- \\nindebtedness categories (Self-Organizing Maps). Finally, section 4.4 \\ndescribes the algorithm used to generate our over-indebtedness predic -\\ntive model (Support Vector Machines). \\n4.1. Data collection \\nIn this work, we used data gathered from consumers under assistance \\nfor over-indebtedness of the Portuguese Association for the Consumer \\nDefense (DECO Portugal). We analyzed the data of the population of \\n1654 consumers nationwide who contacted the debt advisory services in \\nPortugal during the years of 2016 and 2017. In particular, a total of 802 \\nconsumers contacted the debt advisory services in 2016 and 852 con-\\nsumers in 2017. When consumers contact the debt advisory services, \\nthey are over-indebted and cannot pay their bills anymore, having a \\nhigh risk of poverty. These consumers ask for help on how to organize \\ntheir family budget, how to consolidate their debts among the credit \\nholders (e.g., bank, insurance companies, stores), or which credits \\nshould they pay first. In extreme cases, the debt advisory services can \\nsuggest which goods they should give up, from simple consumption \\ngoods (e.g., mobile phone, computer) to important long-term goods, \\nsuch as cars and their houses. \\nThe dataset comprises a broad range of variables to understand the \\nfull picture of consumers’ financial health: family socio-demographics, \\ntotal income, total expenses, employment information, as well as all \\ncredit details. The features considered for the analyses were: socio- \\ndemographic characterization (marital status, level of education \\ncompleted, number of people in the household), the perceived causes for \\nover-indebtedness (from a predetermined pool of causes), and data \\nconcerning their economic situation, including the total income and \\nexpenses of the household as well as data concerning their credits and \\ndebts (amount of the monthly installments for credit cards, housing \\ncredit, car credit, personal credit and other types of credit or debts; total \\nmonthly installment concerning all credits). Each household is repre -\\nsented by one record (one observation) of the dataset with many features \\nto describe their characteristics and behavior. Appendix A summarizes \\nthe main variables analyzed in this study. \\n4.2. Machine learning (ML) approach \\nIn this paper, we present a study aimed at distinguishing and \\ndescribing the cluster profiles of over-indebtedness of Portuguese citi-\\nzens, based on their main characteristics and behavior. This research \\nalso intends to create predictive models to classify the consumers into \\nthe appropriate over-indebtedness profiles. Based on these research \\nobjectives, this research approach combined unsupervised and super -\\nvised Machine Learning (ML) techniques, to jointly analyze descriptive Table 1 \\nBusiness research studies using machine learning algorithms.  \\nAuthors Algorithms \\ntested Context Empirical/ \\nConceptual AutoML \\nBejou et al. \\n(1996) Artificial Neural \\nNetworks Customer \\nrelationship \\nmanagement Empirical No \\nCoussement \\nand De Bock \\n(2013) Decision trees, \\ngeneralized \\nadditive model, \\nrandom forest, \\nand GAMens Customer churn \\nprediction in \\nthe online \\ngambling Empirical No \\nDelen and \\nZolbanin \\n(2018) None (review of \\ndescriptive, \\npredictive, and \\nprescriptive \\nalgorithms) Analytics \\nparadigm in \\nbusiness \\nresearch Conceptual No \\nFernandes \\net al.

The methodo -\\nlogical approach was divided into 4 phases: (1) data preparation, (2) \\ndata selection, (3) unsupervised ML, and (4) supervised ML. \\nIn the data preparation phase, data preprocessing activities were \\nexecuted to prepare and normalize the data of 2016 and 2017, and to \\ngenerate new features to extract information hidden in the existing \\nfeatures (feature engineering). With the prepared data, the second phase \\n(data selection) performed the feature selection to eliminate data \\nredundancy. For every set of features, it was applied an analysis of \\nextreme outliers to treat the noise (or errors ) in the data — each set \\nreceiving its specific outlier treatment instead of performing the same \\naction for the entire dataset. Consequently, this procedure of outlier \\ntreatment does not affect the entire dataset and there is no risk of losing \\nimportant information for other features. The presence of extreme out-\\nliers was detected using univariate and multivariate analysis in all \\nnumeric variables. In univariate analysis, these variables had few ob-\\nservations with values two times higher of the upper limit (one of the \\ncriteria used to filter extreme outliers). The multivariate analysis of \\nextreme outliers further supported most of the extreme outliers selected \\nby univariate analysis. As an outcome, the extreme outliers removed \\nrepresent 5.25% (87 observations). Therefore, from a total of 1654 ob-\\nservations, 1567 were used to generate and test the models. To remove \\nthe potential bias associated with the different order of magnitude of the \\nvalues of the input features, we performed a normalization process. In \\nthis way, all the numerical features range in the interval [0;1]. The \\nnormalization only used information calculated on the training set. \\nThus, the minimum and the maximum of each feature were calculated \\nonly on the training samples. One-hot-encoding was applied to the \\ncategorical features. The process for obtaining the one-hot encoding of a \\ncategorical variable first requires that the categorical values are mapped \\ninto integer values. Subsequently, each integer value is represented as a \\nbinary vector that contains all zero values, except the index of the \\ninteger which contains a one. This transformation is necessary, when \\nthere is no ordinal relationship between the categories, to remove any \\nbias associated with the integer representation of the categories. \\nConcerning unsupervised ML, we have used clustering analysis to \\ndescribe the data through a set of distinguishable clusters, grouping \\nconsumers with common characteristics and consumption behavior. For \\ncluster profiling analysis, the approach of this study also designed and \\ndeveloped an algorithm to automate the cluster profiling generation, \\nfiltering the main statistical differences among the clusters and high-\\nlighting the specific characteristics of each cluster. After clustering \\nanalysis, the supervised ML phase evaluated several estimators (gener -\\nated by AutoML design) and selected the best method (“winner ” model) \\nto classify the profile of consumers based on their characteristics and \\nbehavior. The final method was chosen by model performance metrics \\nthat were selected carefully following the nature of the dataset and the \\ntarget feature (profile-clustering). The following sections detail the \\nprocedures for unsupervised and supervised ML in this study. For both \\nunsupervised and supervised ML, we do not consider Deep Learning. \\nWhile the use of Deep Learning was proposed in recent literature on ML \\nfor social good (Al-Hashedi, Soon, & Goh, 2019; Khatua, Cambria, & \\nKhatua, 2018; Sawhney, Manchanda, Mathur, Shah, & Singh, 2018 ), the \\nproblem considered in this paper is characterized by a limited amount of \\ndata. Therefore, considering that Deep Learning provides accurate \\nmodels when a vast amount of training data is available, we do not rely \\non this ML technique. \\n4.3. Unsupervised ML: self-organizing maps \\nTo identify and describe the consumers ’ profiles groups of over- indebtedness, we employed Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). SOM is an \\nunsupervised learning computational method, belonging to the field of \\nartificial neural networks (Haykin, 1994 ). This technique was recently \\nemployed to address several complex tasks over different domains and \\nproduced competitive results. For instance, it was used in conjunction \\nwith Deep Learning and Principal Component Analysis to successfully \\nsolve a human sentiment classification problem (Ali et al., 2019 ); it was \\nused in the field of electricity consumption and power systems (Ghadiri \\n& Mazlumi, 2020 ); and it was used for heartbeat analysis (Lee, Song, & \\nLee, 2020 ). Thus, the flexibility of SOMs makes it a suitable technique in \\nthe context of our study. \\nSOMs are commonly used as a clustering and visualization technique \\nin exploratory data analysis. For instance, they can be used to group sets \\nof data observations according to their mutual similarities (clustering). \\nGiven a particular distance metric, typically groups are formed to \\nmaximize the intra-cluster distances and minimize inter-cluster dis-\\ntances. A trained SOM, that can make such a categorization of data, is \\nnormally referred to as a descriptive model of the data. Another typical \\nuse of a SOM is to transform input data of arbitrary dimension into a \\nlower (typically two) dimensional discrete map, and to perform this \\ntransformation adaptively, preserving the topological features of the \\noriginal input space. \\nAmong the different SOM variants, we considered in this work the \\nKohonen Network (Kohonen, 2013 ). This SOM has a feed-forward \\nstructure, where neurons are set along an n-dimensional grid: typical \\napplications assume a 2-dimensions rectangular grid (e.g., 10 ×10). \\nEach neuron is fully connected to all the source nodes in the input layer, \\nand the connection weights are initialized with small random values, or \\nwith appropriate input values. This single-layer neural network repre -\\nsents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. These \\nmodels are automatically associated with the nodes of the grid, so \\nsimilar models become automatically associated with nodes that are \\nadjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther \\naway from each other in the grid (Kohonen, 2013 ). In this way, the grid \\ngradually becomes a 2-dimensional transformation of the input space, \\npreserving the topology of the input data. \\nTraining a SOM requires several iterative steps. For a generic input \\npattern (or data observation) £, the following steps must be executed \\n(Resta, 2012 ): (1) evaluate the distance between £and the vector of \\nweights of the synaptic connections entering in each neuron. For \\ninstance, the Euclidean distance between the input vector £and the \\nweight vector can be considered; (2) select the neuron (node) with the \\nsmallest distance to £(i.e., “winner neuron ” or Best Matching Unit – \\nBMU); (3) correct the position (i.e., by modifying the weights) of each \\nnode according to the results of Step (2), to preserve the network to-\\npology. This iterative process continues until a stopping criterion is \\nreached. Typically, the stopping criterion considers a weighted average \\nover the Euclidean norms of the difference between the input vector and \\nthe corresponding best matching unit. \\nOnce the training procedure is concluded, the result consists of a \\ndescriptive model that considers how the input space is structured and \\nprojects it into a lower-dimensional space, where closer nodes represent \\nneighboring input patterns. Thus, a SOM is particularly suitable for \\nvisualizing hidden patterns from the multi-dimensional input data. The \\nElbow method and Silhouette were used as cluster definition techniques \\nto determine the optimal number of three clusters (see Appendix B for \\ndetails). \\nThe grid size defined for this study was 100 cells (dimension ×=10 \\nand dimension y =10) presenting good results, with a good distribution \\nof observation in the nodes, and it did not generate any empty node \\n(nodes without any observations). The topo is a parameter to define the \\nway nodes are arranged in the grid (100 nodes, dimension ×=10, and \\ndimension y =10). The nodes of the grid can be arranged as rectangular \\nor hexagonal, it defines the number of immediate neighbors, rectangular \\nshapes have 4 immediate neighbors, and hexagonal shapes have 6 im-\\nmediate neighbors. The alpha parameter defines the learning rate, M.

The default value is \\nto decline linearly from 0.05 to 0.01 over each iteration. The whatmap \\ndefines which data layers were used, and the configuration used the final \\nfeature selection: categorical variables: (1) cause classification (crisis \\nand other causes not related to the crisis); and numerical variables: (2) \\nincome per capita, (3) total expenses, (4) effort rate with credit card, (5) \\neffort rate with housing credit, (6) effort rate with car credit, (7) effort \\nrate with personal credit, and (8) effort rate other types of credit or \\ndebts. \\nThe dist.fcts parameter is a vector of distance functions to be used to \\ncalculate the distances among nodes: Tanimotodistance (for categorical \\ndata/factors) (Lipkus, 1999 ) and Euclidean distance (for numeric fea-\\ntures) (Gower & Legendre, 1986 ). The keep.data parameter defines the \\nreturn of a trained map. If keep.data is true, it returns original data and \\nmapping information; if false, it only returns the mapping information \\n(trained map). \\n4.4. Supervised ML: support vector machines \\nSupport Vector Machines (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995 ) are supervised ML \\ntechniques that can be used for addressing classification and regression \\ntasks. The objective of Support Vector Machines is to establish the \\nequation of a hyperplane that divides the space, leaving all the points of \\nthe same class on the same side, and separating points belonging to \\ndifferent classes. Among the possible hyperplanes, a Support Vector Machine selects \\nby construction the one that maximizes the distance (margin) of the \\nhyperplane from the closest data points of each class (support vectors). \\nThis hyperplane is usually called maximum separation hyperplane, and \\nit is usually addressed as a predictive model. Once a Support Vector \\nMachine is trained (i.e., the maximum separation hyperplane has been \\nachieved), the prediction of new unlabeled information can be per-\\nformed. New observations will be categorized as belonging to the same \\nclass as the points that stand on the same side of the maximum sepa-\\nration hyperplane. This results in a robust classifier that maximizes the \\nprobability of classifying a new data point in the correct class, thus \\nensuring an appropriate generalization ability. When the points are not \\nlinearly separable, Support Vector Machines transform (through a \\nfunction called kernel ) the original space of data, to map into a new \\nhigher dimensional space, where the data points are linearly separable. \\nThen, the maximum separation hyperplane can be achieved in this new \\nmapped space. Support Vector Machines can be used to address both \\nclassification and regression problems. In the first case, it is common to \\nrefer to them as Support Vector for Classification (SVC). Thus, in the \\ncontinuation of the paper, we will refer to Support Vector Machines as \\nSVC. For a full understanding of the properties of Support Vector Ma-\\nchines and the definition of kernel functions, the interested reader is \\nreferred to Sch¨olkopf, Smola, and Bach (2002) . \\nTo define the design of the grid search approach, the characteristics \\nof the dataset and the target feature (cluster profile) were considered. \\nFig. 1.Supervised Machine Learning algorithms that have been used in this work.

Consequently, a wide range of classifiers (machine \\nlearning algorithms) was used: (1) Nu-support Vector Machine, (2) \\nSupport Vector Machine, (3) Gradient Boosting, (4) Extra Trees, (5) \\nRandom Forest, (6) Decision Trees, (7) Gaussian Naive Bayes, (8) K \\nNearest Neighbors, (9) Linear Discriminant Analysis, and (10) Logistic \\nRegression. Each classifier has a different set of parameters following the \\nalgorithm design (development) and objectives of optimization. Fig. 1 \\nshows the algorithms and the parameters tested by the Grid Search for \\neach ML method. \\nThis research uses a three-step approach designed to use Grid Search \\nHyperparameters Tuning (see Fig. 2 for details). The hyperparameter \\ntuning phase is the first step of this approach. This step consists of a set of \\nexperiments to test the range of possible values or existing options of a \\nparameter to find good configurations. Therefore, 32,730 intermediate \\nmodels were tested for these hyperparameters. As an outcome, we ob-\\ntained a range of parameters for each ML algorithm and this generated \\n6546 candidate models. \\nThe second step (training performance) aims to select the most \\nappropriate configuration of each algorithm (e.g. Nu-Support Vector \\nMachine, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, etc.). So far, only \\nthe training set has been used to assess the different models (using 5- \\nfolds cross-validation). To evaluate the performance of the models, \\ntwo main metrics were used: accuracy score and logistic loss (log loss).  \\n•Accuracy Score: the accuracy score is obtained through the division \\nof total correct predictions overall observations, assuming values \\nbetween 0 and 1. The goal of each predictor is to maximize the ac-\\ncuracy score (approximately 1).  \\n•Logistic Loss: the logistic loss (or log loss) provides a nuanced view \\nof the models ’ performance, considering the uncertainty of a pre-\\ndiction and calculating how many times it varies from the actual \\nlabel. If the predicted probability diverges from the actual label, the \\nlog loss increases, assuming values between 0 and infinite. The \\nobjective of the classifiers is to minimize the log loss value, conse -\\nquently, a perfect model would have a log loss equal to 0. \\nThe third step is the model selection and generalization ability. After the best model for each algorithm is found — with its most appropriate \\nhyperparameter combination — the test set is used to assess these \\nmodels and the best one is selected (winning model). \\n5.Findings \\n5.1. Self-organizing maps and over-indebtedness clustering \\nAn Automated ML algorithm was developed to create and select the \\nbest descriptive model and generate cluster profiling automatically. The \\nautomated profiling description highlighted the distinguishable char-\\nacteristics of each cluster, showing the values of similar clusters and \\nranking the variables by statistical tests for numeric and categorical \\nvariables. Several descriptive models for Self-Organizing Maps were \\ngenerated with different parameters and sets of features, comparing the \\ncluster results performance, number of clusters, and profiling. The final \\nselection was based on the analysis and capacity of cluster description \\n(descriptive ability) in accordance with over-indebtedness analysis \\nconsiderations. The final descriptive model used the Kohonen R Package \\n(R Studio), using the method supersom (Supervised SOM) with the \\nfollowing parameter configuration: rlen =3000 iterations; alpha =0.05; \\ntopo =hexagonal; and grid size =100 cells (10 ×10). After 3000 iter-\\nations, the mean distance between the observations of each node was \\nreduced to 0.015. Fig. 3 shows the progress of SOM training and the \\ndecrease of the mean distance to the closest unit distance over time \\n(iterations). \\nHowever, it is important to note that some variables did not achieve \\nstatistical significance in the cluster profiling analysis. Indeed, the dif-\\nferences among groups are not statically significant for education level \\n(χ2(4 , 1455) =0.9608, p =0.9157) nor years of education (F(2 , 1564) =\\n0.5813, p =0.5593, ηp2 =7e-04). The total income is also not statistically \\nsignificant to distinguish the groups (F(2 , 1564) =0.9568, p =0.3844, ηp2 \\n=0.0012), only income per capita is statistically significant (F(2 , 1564) =\\n162.6146, p <0.001 ηp2 =0.1721). \\n5.2. Over-Indebtedness cluster profiling and description \\nAs final outcome, SOM training extracted 3 clusters with distin -\\nguishable characteristics: low-income households (n =490, 31.27%), \\nlow credit control households (n =586, 37.40%), crisis-affected \\nhouseholds (n =491, 31.33%). \\nCluster 1 – Low-income households: In this cluster, 100% of \\nFig. 2.Grid Search Hyperparameters Tuning Process.

Table 2 provides the cluster profiling automated \\nfeature selection. \\n5.3. Support vector machine and over-indebtedness prediction \\nThe supervised ML phase used Automated ML supervised Grid Search \\nHyperparameters Tuning in Python to search the most appropriate \\nexperimental setting. In this study, an exhaustive search using Grid \\nSearch Hyperparameters Tuning generated 32,730 intermediate models \\nduring the cross-validation stratified 5-fold, creating 6546 candidate \\nmodels in total. To define the design of the grid search approach, the \\ncharacteristics of the dataset and the target feature were considered \\n(cluster profile). These characteristics also were considered to select the \\nML algorithms to be tested in the grid search, to classify the profiles of \\nover-indebtedness. \\nThe exhaustive search of the Grid Search Hyperparameters Tuning \\ncan be done for several algorithm types, exploiting many approaches to \\ndevelop the best model possible to classify the profiles of over- \\nindebtedness. Consequently, a wide range of classifiers was used: (1) \\nNu-support Vector Machine, (2) Support Vector Machine, (3) Gradient \\nBoosting, (4) Extra Trees, (5) Random Forest, (6) Decision Trees, (7) \\nGaussian Naive Bayes, (8) K Nearest Neighbors, (9) Linear Discriminant \\nAnalysis, and (10) Logistic Regression. \\nWhen searching for the best estimator, the objective is to split the \\ndata into two sets (training set vs. test set) and use them as input for the \\nalgorithm to learn the parameters that best describe the patterns un-\\nderlying the data and afterward assess their performance. The hyper- \\nparameters are the algorithm ’s parameters that are not directly \\nlearned within estimators and need to be defined prior to training. \\nFor the present study, an exhaustive cross-validation search was \\nimplemented in order to reach the best possible hyperparameter com-\\nbination for each algorithm. First, the data was split into training and \\ntest sets. Then, for cross-validation, the training set was further divided \\ninto 5 partitions for the study. These 5 folds of data are used in the same \\nway as training (80%) and test set (20%), in the sense that 4 folds are \\ncombined as input to learning the data and one-fold is used to evaluate \\nthe quality of the resulting model. The objective is to compare the \\nperformance of each hyperparameter. Thus, the process is run several \\ntimes, each with a different combination of hyperparameter values. \\nOnce the best arrangement is found, the algorithm is trained with the \\nelected hyperparameters on all the 5 folds — and the learning phase is \\nrepeated on the entire training set. \\nThe performance of each winner classifier is presented in Figs. 4a and \\n4b. During this analysis, 4 models were removed from the selection, \\nbecause their performance was much lower than the one of the other \\nalgorithms. The removed methods were: (6) Decision Trees, (7) \\nGaussian Naive Bayes (9) Linear Discriminant Analysis, and (10) Lo-\\ngistic Regression. In particular, the poor performance of Linear \\nDiscriminant Analysis and Logistic regression seems to suggest that the \\nproblem under analysis is particularly complex. As a consequence, the \\naforementioned techniques cannot provide good-quality models \\nbecause they cannot solve non-linear problems since their decision \\nboundary is linear. Focusing on Gaussian Naïve Bayes, its poor perfor -\\nmance is mainly due to the “naïve ” assumption made by the algorithm: it \\nassumes conditional independence between every pair of features given \\nthe value of the class variable. Finally, the poor performance of Decision \\nTrees could be motivated by the fact that they are unstable, with a small \\nchange in the data leading to a large change in the structure of the \\noptimal decision tree, making it difficult for the Decision Trees algo-\\nrithm to learn and express these features. After the performance analysis on the training set, the six algorithms \\nthat returned the best results in their categories were: SVC, Nu-SVC, \\nExtra Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and K Nearest Neigh -\\nbors. For the models generated by these six algorithms, their general -\\nization ability was assessed by evaluating their performance on the test \\nset (unseen data). Fig. 5 shows a comparison of their performance, using \\nAccuracy Score and Log Loss. \\nThe algorithm that generated the best model after this exhaustive \\nsearch was a version of the Support Vector Machine algorithm, the Nu- \\nSVC. The Nu-SVC is similar to SVC but uses a regularization parameter to \\ncontrol the number of support vectors implementing a penalty on the \\nmisclassifications that are performed while separating the classes. As the \\nNu-SVC was the winning classifier, in the next section it will be \\ndescribed the functioning of this algorithm. The best-fitting model of Nu- \\nSVC generated automatically had the following parameters (see Table 3 \\nfor details): Nu (0.08), Kernel (RBF), Gamma (Scale), Decision Function \\nShape (ovr), and Class Weight (balanced). Table 4 presents detailed \\nMachine Learning algorithms comparative performance. \\n6.Discussion \\nThe first global challenge in terms of sustainable development goals \\nelected by the United Nations 2030 Agenda is ending poverty in all its \\nFig. 4a.Accuracy Score – Machine Algorithms.  \\nFig. 4b.Log Loss - ML Algorithms.

Research in business and \\npsychological sciences has related the risk of over-indebtedness and \\nscarcity to several different factors. Financial illiteracy (Lusardi & \\nMitchell, 2011 ), the prevalence of intuitive judgments and decisions \\nbased on heuristics (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008 ), impulsiveness, and lack \\nof self-control (Mani et al., 2013 ) are dominant theoretical accounts \\ntypically used to explain how households become over-indebted. \\nFurthermore, socio-economical abrupt changes often prompted by \\nfinancial crisis such as the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the Euro-\\npean sovereign debts crisis and the ongoing economic shock caused by \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic are known to increase consumers financial \\nvulnerability and ability to pay their debts when due (e.g., Alleweldt \\net al., 2013 ; Tokunaga, 1993 ). \\nHowever, none of the aforementioned factors determines by itself \\nover-indebtedness. Actual cases of over-indebted households result from \\ndifferent combinations of factors and these combinations are likely to \\nform meaningful clusters or profiles. In other words, over-indebtedness \\nis not a unified concept but may come in many forms. \\nTo empirically support the claim that over-indebtedness does not \\nspeak with one voice this research used a bottom-up approach based on \\nAutomated Machine Learning (AutoML) to develop descriptive and \\npredictive models of distinguishable profiles of over-indebtedness \\n(based on specific configurations of households features). \\n7.Theoretical and methodological contributions \\nOur findings suggest that the consumers ’ socio-economical features \\ndo not vary randomly but clustered together in three emerging profiles. \\nEconomic crises are often pointed out in the public arena as being among \\nthe main situational causes of over-indebtedness. However, in the \\naftermath of the Portuguese financial and socio-economic crunch, our \\nfindings indicate that over-indebtedness is associated mainly with other \\nsituational causes for both low-income households and low credit con-\\ntrol households, with only one profile of over-indebtedness (accounting \\nfor less than one-third of the cases) directly related to the economic crisis. \\nIn light of this profile classification, it seems reasonable to conclude \\nthat although the social-economic crisis that besieged Portugal certainly \\nincreased the financial vulnerability of households, it can hardly be \\nconsidered the immediate cause of all or even most cases of over- \\nindebtedness. Other situational causes not directly related to the crisis \\ncharacterize the majority of over-indebted families. \\nFurthermore, the emergence of the low income and low credit con-\\ntrol profiles suggest that lack of self-regulation may be more a conse -\\nquence of the emotional strain and cognitive overload that progressively \\ndeplete self-control capacity (e.g., Mani et al., 2013 ) in the first of these \\nprofiles; whereas dispositional low levels of self-control are more likely \\nto be a cause (or important risk factor) of over-indebtedness (e.g., Eigsti \\net al., 2006 ) for the latter profile. \\nIn the same vein, although heuristic-based judgment may contribute \\nto decision biases across all profiles, in the case of the low credit control \\nprofile, failures to second guess intuitive (but biased) responses and \\nreplace them with more deliberate decisions are more likely to work as a \\npredecessor of over-indebtedness due to individual differences in \\nrational behavior (e.g., Stanovich, 2009 ). For low-income and crisis- \\naffected families, the same failures are more likely to begin as a conse -\\nquence of the depletion of cognitive resources associated with over- \\nindebtedness and then contribute to accentuate a spiral of biased de-\\ncisions. By empirically distinguishing various profiles, the bottom-up \\napproach we adopted shows potential for explaining in a coherent \\nway how different psychological mechanisms may interact with situa-\\ntional risk factors to carve specific types of over-indebtedness. \\nMethodologically, our findings contribute to business research pre-\\nsenting an AutoML perspective for social good. AutoML automates the \\nconfiguration and selection of a complex machine learning model of \\nover-indebtedness and fosters the generation of robust models – that is, \\nmodels that are resistant to data variations and able to provide a more \\naccurate data generalization (compared to single ML algorithms \\ntesting), reducing possible errors and biases that may occur using a \\nhuman-based design of specific machine learning model. \\nAlthough recent studies have explored analytical approaches in \\nsrobhgieNK gnitsooBtneidarG eerTartxE\\ntseroFmodnaR CVS CVS-uNFig. 5.Top 6 Classifiers - Model Comparison.

In one of the first analytic attempts in business research, Bejou, \\nWray, and Ingram (1996) explored Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) \\non customer relationship management. Fish, Johnson, Dorsey, and \\nBlodgett (2004) and Hamid and Iqbal (2004) also explored ANNs to \\nmodel brand market share and forecast volatility of S&P 500 futures \\nprices, making important contributions to the field. \\nOnly recently, business research approaches have become more so-\\nphisticated, using not only ANNs but also different ML algorithms such \\nas random forests (Coussement & De Bock, 2013 ) and SVMs (Moro, Rita, & Vala, 2016 ). These approaches investigated ML algorithms in domains \\nsuch as online reviews (Singh et al., 2017 ), online gambling (Cousse -\\nment & De Bock, 2013 ), social media performance (Moro et al., 2016 ), \\nand academic performance (Fernandes et al., 2019 ). In this context, and \\nto the best of our knowledge, the work here reported represents the first \\nattempt of exploiting AutoML in business research (see Table 1 for de-\\ntails). By doing so, our AutoML approach was able to promptly return \\naccurate results on an external validation dataset of new over-indebted \\ncases (unknown to the algorithm during the learning phase). Such re-\\nsults have important practical and social implications. \\n7.1. Practical and social implications \\nIn terms of practical and social implications, it follows from the \\nabove that the development of measures to fight over-indebtedness \\nwould considerably gain if one could a) differentiate among different \\nprofiles in a sample of identified over-indebted households; and b) based \\non this classification, not only estimate the risk of future cases of over- \\nindebtedness but also anticipate the more adequate measures to \\nreduce poverty risk. \\nGiven that over-indebtedness is not a unified concept as indicated by \\nthe surfacing of different profiles (involving different risk factors), in-\\nterventions to counteract and prevent households from becoming over- \\nindebted should be adapted to each profile. Different policy measures \\nput forward in Portugal (and other European Countries) have contrib -\\nuted to the socio-economic recovery (e.g., promoting entrepreneurship \\nand employment creation, reposition of income). Although this certainly \\nreduced the financial strain over many Portuguese households, it is not \\nsurprising, in light of our results, that positive signs of economic re-\\ncovery do not necessarily translate into an overall reduction of over- \\nindebted households. Thus, even if the macro economical relief felt in \\nthe last few years has helped reduce over-indebtedness, there are at least \\ntwo other profiles much less dependent on crisis-related factors that \\nmight continue to grow in number. Indeed, in 2019 the indebtedness of \\nPortuguese families attained the maximum values of the last three years, \\nwith a steady number (of about 29.000 new cases a year) of households \\nrecurring to DECO over-indebtedness support office. \\nBy using AutoML, our model drastically reduced the time and costs of \\ndesigning and developing a financial solution for over-indebted house -\\nholds. After testing several thousands of different algorithms using \\nAutoML, it was possible to predict the profile of over-indebted house -\\nholds with a high accuracy level. Results of Support Vector Machines \\nindicated that Nu-Support Vector Clustering had the best accuracy in \\npredicting causes for over-indebtedness (89.5%). Such high predictive \\npower is revealing of the applied value of using machine learning \\napproach in the current domain of households ’ financial debts.

For \\nthat, there is a beta version of the software that will contribute to \\nreducing the time needed to identify consumers’ debt profiles from the \\ncurrent 1–2 weeks to a few seconds. This software uses the AutoML \\nmodel here presented to classify new cases of over-indebtedness into one \\nof the three profiles and is further able to provide feedback to non- \\noverindebted consumers based on their similarity (feature overlap) \\nwith the different profiles of over-indebtedness. The App has a user- \\nfriendly interface making it suitable to be used directly by the con-\\nsumers or as a tool for more in-depth expert financial analysis. In sum, \\nthe more precise and agile these models become the more helpful their \\nsoftware implementations can be in providing information to not only \\nbetter counseling indebted consumers but also to anticipate the risk of \\nfuture cases of over-indebtedness, reducing poverty risk. \\nFurthermore, the systematic and continuous use of classification and \\nprediction models of machine learning could and probably should play \\nan important role in informing new policies to empower households and \\nfight the negative effects of scarcity and over-indebtedness. In this sense, \\na recent follow-up project developed in 2020 in partnership with the \\nPortuguese Government (Ministry of Economy – Consumer Protection) \\nis planning tailored interventions to prevent over-indebtedness to better \\nfit each profile. This project is estimated to be conducted until 2022, \\nhelping an estimated number of 2000 consumers per year. \\n7.2. Limitations and future research \\nThis work opens several possible research opportunities using \\nAutoML in business research. Based on our findings using AutoML to \\npredict over-indebtedness, we foresee that any organization or company \\ncould effectively use such solutions to address their practical business \\nproblems. For instance, AutoML can be used in healthcare, marketing, \\nretail, transportation, and many other areas that are not covered in the \\ncurrent research. Future research should be conducted to examine \\nAutoML applications to other business research areas. \\nOne of the limitations of the current research concerns the lack of \\ndata in the profiles concerning several of the psychological and situa-\\ntional risk factors. Adding to the database questions or tasks that could provide us with measures of consumers’ tendency to rely on improper \\nheuristics, individual differences in self-control, innumeracy, attitudes \\ntowards credit, mental accounting, well-being, etc., would be crucial to \\nbe able to confirm the initial results here reported and to refine our \\nanalyses and conclusions. Future research could add more fine-grained \\ninformation to allow improving artificial intelligence tools’ ability to \\nclassify and describe the over-indebtedness profiles. \\nIn addition, there were no differences in educational levels across the \\nthree profiles. Considering the educational level as a proxy of literacy in \\ngeneral and financial literacy in particular, this suggests that financial \\nilliteracy did not play a distinguishable causal role in our analysis. Given \\nthe low level of financial literacy typically found in surveys conducted in \\nPortugal, we suspect that innumeracy and financial illiteracy may have \\ncontributed to all profiles of over-indebtedness. However, we cannot be \\nsure since the available data did not include a direct measure of financial \\nliteracy. \\nFinally, the use of AutoML could be extended as a robust method -\\nology to describe and analyze other forms of poverty. Indeed, poverty is \\nlikely to refer to a myriad of different forms of scarcity closely related to \\ndistinctive social-economic realities. The bottom-up approach followed \\nin this paper appears suitable to study such diversity. Research and \\ntheory in business and psychological sciences concerning the explana -\\ntions and causes of poverty may then be used to give meaning to the \\nArtificial intelligence results and to complement them with other \\nmethods (e.g., behavioral experiments). \\nDeclaration of Competing Interest \\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial \\ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence \\nthe work reported in this paper. \\nAcknowledgments \\nThis study was partially supported by Grant PTDC/MHC-PAP/1556/ \\n2014 and DSAIPA/DS/0113/2019 from the Foundation for Science and \\nTechnology of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Portugal).  \\nAppendix A \\nDataset Variables   \\nFeature Data Type Group Note \\nProcess Number Categorical N/A Unique anonymous identifier of consumer process \\nMarital Status Categorical Social-demographic  \\nPeople in the household Numeric Social-demographic  \\nLevel of Education Categorical Social-demographic  \\nYears of study Numeric Social-demographic  \\nEmployment status Categorical Social-demographic From a predetermined set of employment status \\nCauses of over-indebtedness Categorical Perceived Causes From a predetermined set of causes \\nCause classification Categorical Perceived Causes Crisis and Other \\nIncome Total Numeric Economic Situation In Euros \\nIncome per capita Numeric Economic Situation In Euros \\nIncome after Expenses (Net Income) Numeric Economic Situation In Euros \\nExpenses of the household Numeric Economic Situation In Euros \\nExpenses per capita Numeric Economic Situation In Euros \\nExpenses – effort rate Numeric Economic Situation % of income \\nAll credits - monthly installment Numeric Economic Situation In Euros \\nAll credits - quantity Numeric Economic Situation  \\nAll credits - effort rate Numeric Economic Situation % of income \\nCredit Card - monthly installment Numeric Economic Situation In Euros \\nCredit Card - quantity Numeric Economic Situation  \\nCredit Card - effort rate Numeric Economic Situation % of income \\nCredit Card - participation Numeric Economic Situation % of Credits Total \\nHousing Credit - monthly installment Numeric Economic Situation In Euros \\nHousing Credit - quantity Numeric Economic Situation  \\n(continued on next page) M.

INTRODUCTION\\nAmong the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) officially launched in 2015, poverty eradication \\ntopped the list. Included in the Global Indicator Framework for monitoring progress on poverty \\nreduction is the proportion of a country’s population living b elow its national poverty line, which is \\ntypically sourced from household income and expenditure surveys. From the perspective of \\nstatisticians and other compilers of official poverty statistics, the SDGs’ leave no one behind principle \\nwhich requires data to be disaggregated by geographic location, ethnicity, gender, income class, and \\nother relevant dimensions, presents several challenges. Conventionally, household income and \\nexpenditure surveys have sample sizes that are sufficient to provide nationally re presentative \\npoverty estimates, but not large enough to provide reliable estimates at levels granular enough to \\nmeet all disaggregated data requirements of SDG 1. Moreover, the sample sizes are inadequate in \\nproviding reliable estimates at levels granular enough to allow development planners efficiently \\ntarget areas that need immediate poverty intervention (Hofer et al., 2020) . \\nThe integration of geospatial techniques and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in mapping multidimensional \\npoverty has the potential to provide more accurate and refined understandings of poverty, and to \\ninform the development of effective poverty reduction strategies (Steele et al., 2017) . Geospatial \\napproach in mapping multidimensional poverty involves the use of spatial data and mapping \\ntechniques to identify and visualize the spatial distribution of poverty across different dimensions. \\nThis approach combines geospatial data, such as sat ellite imagery and Geographical Information \\nSystems (GIS), with multidimensional poverty measures to produce poverty maps that provide a \\nmore accurate and nuanced understanding of poverty. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied in \\nmapping multidimensi onal poverty to improve the accuracy and efficiency of poverty measurement \\nand analysis (Hersh et al., 2021; Sohnesen et al., 2022) . AI techniques such as machine learning, \\ncomputer vision, and natural language processing is now being applied in analysing large amounts \\nof data and to identify patterns and trends in multidimensional poverty.  \\nSeveral of milestones have been achieved through the integration of satellite data and artificial \\nintelligence in mapping poverty which could facilitate in understanding and addressing poverty. \\nMobile phone and geospatial data have been combined in the pas t to provide insight into the spatial \\ndistribution of poverty measurements (Steele et al., 2017) , allowing for more frequent and granular \\ndatasets.  Also, open -source satellite imagery features and machine learning has been incorporated \\nto improve poverty mapping accuracy, making it more practical for most applications (Hersh et al., \\n2021) . Convolutional Neural Networks has been applied on high -resolution satellite images of cities \\nin Mozambique and combined their outputs with household level geo -referenced survey data to \\ngenerate detailed neighborhood -level poverty maps, providing key oper ational guidance for \\nimplementation of the urban social safety net (Sohnesen et al., 2022) . Supplementing survey data \\nwith satellite data has proven an improved poverty estimate (Klemens et al., 2015) . \\nSatellite imagery can be used to identify features such as housing, infrastructure, and vegetation, \\nwhich can be used as indicators of poverty. Machine learning algorithms can then be trained to \\nanalyze these features and to identify areas that are most li kely to be affected by poverty (Jean et al., \\n2016; Sohnesen et al., 2022) .

Natural language processing techniques is applied to analyze \\nthese data sources and to identify indicators of poverty and the live experiences of those affected by \\npoverty. GIS can be used to combine and visualize m ultiple data sources, such as satellite imagery, \\ncensus data, and survey data, to create a more comprehensive understanding of poverty across \\ndifferent dimensions. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to develop predictive models that \\ncan forecast ch anges in poverty over time (Steele et al., 2017) . The study of (Jean et al., 2016)  \\ndemonstrated an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for estimating consumption \\nexpenditure and asset wealth from high -resolution satellite imagery using a convolutional neural \\nnetwork, which could transform efforts to track and target poverty in dev eloping countries.  \\nAccuracy is germane in mapping multi -dimensional poverty, considering the limitations in the \\naccuracy of satellite -based poverty maps. The accuracy of satellite -based poverty maps is limited by \\nfactors such as the quality of the satellite imagery and the a vailability of ground truth data (Ayush et \\nal., 2020) . An interpretable computational framework to accurately predict poverty has been \\ndemonstrated at a local level by applying object detectors to high -resolution satellite images (Ayush \\net al., 2020) . An accuracy of 0.539 Pearson's R2 was achieved in predicting village -level poverty in \\nUganda, which indicated a 31% improvement over existing benchmarks. Again, a global poverty map \\nat 30 arcsec resolution using a poverty index calculated by dividing population count by the \\nbrightness of satellite observed lighting was produced (Elvidge et al., 2009) .  \\nSatellite -based poverty maps can be a useful tool for estimating poverty, especially in areas where \\ntraditional census data is unavailable or out -of-date. For instance, (Jarry et al., 2021)  proposed a \\nnew methodology combining grid -cell selection and ensembling to improve poverty prediction. \\n(Elvidge et al., 2009)  produced a global poverty map using a poverty index calculated from satellite \\nobserved lighting and population count, calibrated using national level poverty data. Furthermore, \\nstudies in metropolitan areas of North and South America have showcased the fe asibility of \\nestimating household income and socio -economic conditions, by applications of computer vision to \\nsatellite imagery (Piaggesi et al., 2019) . Satellite -based poverty maps are of great benefit in \\ncomplementing traditional poverty maps, especially in areas where census data is limited.  \\nEven though the satellite and machine learning approach are of great benefit, there are limitations to \\nits use.  Considering the findings of (Hersh et al., 2021) , although incorporating open -source satellite \\ndata improved poverty mapping, proprietary imagery can be costly and infrequently acquired.  Again, \\nin the study involving the convolutional neural networks on high -resolution satellite images to \\ngenerate neigh borhood -level poverty maps in Mozambique (Sohnesen et al., 2022) , an interpretable \\ncomputational framework to predict poverty at a local level using object detectors on high -resolution \\nsatellite images, achieving improved accuracy and interpretability in poverty mapping in Uganda \\n(Ayush et al., 2020) . A lack of detailed data on poverty was observed to be common in many \\ndeveloping countries  especially in Africa.  Satellite data alone may not be sufficient for poverty \\nmapping, as such incorporating survey -derived variables may improve model performance (Hersh \\net al., 2021) . While satellite data can be a useful tool for poverty mapping, studies have suggested \\nthat it should be used in conjunction with other data sources, considering its limitations.  \\nThis paper focuses on review of the milestones achieved in integrating geospatial techniques and \\nartificial intelligence in mapping multidimensional poverty in Africa for the purpose of proffering \\n\", metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/Satellite and artificial intelligence in mapping multidimensional poverty in AfricaA reviewstudy.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Finally potential areas relevant for future \\nresearch in the aspect of multidimensional poverty would be identified.  \\n2. POVERTY MEASURES AND CONCEPTS OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY   \\nThere are several measures and approaches used to measure poverty. Here are some commonly used \\npoverty measures these include: Income Poverty; Multidimensional Poverty  (Alkire & Foster, 2011; \\nWorld Bank, 2020) ; Human Development Index (HDI), proposed by the United Nations Development \\nProgramme (UNDP) (Priambodo, 2021) ; Capability Approach, Proposed by Amartya Sen (Frediani, \\n2010) ; Subjective Poverty (Achdut et al., 2021) ; Absolute and Relative Poverty (Foster, 1998) . These \\nmeasures vary in their focus, scope, and methodology, and are often used in combination to provide \\na more comprehensive understanding of poverty. Each measure has its strengths and limitations, and \\nthe choice of measure depends on the specific cont ext and objectives of the analysis.  \\nMultidimensional poverty is a concept that considers poverty not only in terms of income or \\nconsumption but also in terms of multiple dimensions of deprivation, such as health, education, and \\nliving standards (World Bank, 2022) . It recognizes that poverty is not only about a lack of income or \\nmaterial resources but also about the inability to access basic services and opportunities that are \\nnecessary for a decent standard of living. The multidimensional poverty approach uses a s et of \\nindicators that capture different dimensions of poverty, such as health, education, housing, \\nsanitation, and access to basic services. These indicators are combined to create a multidimensional \\npoverty index (MPI) that measures the extent of poverty in a given population (World Bank, 2018) . \\nThe MPI provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of poverty than income -based \\nmeasures alone. It enables policymakers to identify the specific dimensions of poverty that need to \\nbe addressed and to design targeted interventions that addres s the root causes of poverty (World \\nBank, 2022) . The concept of multidimensional poverty has gained increasing recognition in recent \\nyears, with a growing number of countries adopting MPIs to measure and address poverty. The \\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human D evelopment \\nInitiative (OPHI) are among the organizations that have played a leading role in developing and \\npromoting the use of MPIs (United Nations General Assembly, 2015; World Bank, 2018, 2022) . \\n2.1 Multidimensional Poverty Measure (MPM)  \\nThe Multidimensional Poverty Measure (MPM) introduced by the World Bank has gained popularity \\nas an indicator that gauges the proportion of households facing deprivation across three dimensions \\nof well -being: monetary poverty, education, and basic infrastr ucture services. Its aim is to present a \\nmore comprehensive understanding of poverty. Although poverty is commonly associated with a lack \\nof financial resources, focusing solely on income poverty fails to encompass a broader range of well -\\nbeing indicators.  In fact, the World Bank's Poverty and Shared Prosperity report (World Bank, 2022)  \\ndemonstrates that nearly 39 percent of individuals experiencing multidimensional poverty are not \\nidentified as poor based on income poverty alone.  \\n\", metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/Satellite and artificial intelligence in mapping multidimensional poverty in AfricaA reviewstudy.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

Their methodology combines \\nmultiple indicators or dimensions of poverty, such as education, h ealth, living standards, and social \\nparticipation, into a single poverty index (Alkire & Foster, 2011) . Since its introduction, the Alkire -\\nFoster method has gained widespread recognition and has been applied in various studies and \\nreports to provide a more nuanced understanding of poverty beyond income measures alone (Abeje \\net al., 2020; Batana, 2013) . It has been used to measure multidimensional poverty at the national, \\nregional, and global levels, contributing to policy discussions and interventions aimed at reducing \\npoverty and improving well -being.  \\nThe World Bank developed its Multidimensional Poverty Measure (MPM) in 2018, drawing \\ninspiration from other well -known multidimensional measures such as the Multidimensional \\nPoverty Index (MPI) created by the UNDP and Oxford University. Unlike the MPI, the  MPM includes \\nthe dimension of monetary poverty, which is measured as household income or consumption per \\ncapita falling below $2.15 per day based on the International Poverty Line established in 2017 \\n(Jolliffe et al., 2017) . By incorporating both monetary and non -monetary deprivations, the MPM \\nhighlights to policymakers the significance of addressing various aspects of human welfare beyond \\nincome poverty alone. It recognizes that households in rural areas of Sub -Saharan Afri ca, for instance, \\nmay have sufficient income to surpass monetary poverty but still lack access to vital services like \\nhealthcare, education, or reliable electricity. Conversely, households that are income poor but have \\naccess to basic services may experien ce better well -being than those deprived in non -monetary \\ndimensions such as healthcare or education. The interaction and overlap of multiple dimensions can \\nintensify poverty and inequality, perpetuating cycles of deprivation.  \\nThe Multidimensional Poverty Measure (MPM) encompasses three dimensions of well -being: \\nmonetary standard of living, education, and basic infrastructure services. Within these dimensions, \\nsix standardized indicators are considered: consumption - or income -based poverty, educational \\nenrolment, educational attainment, access to drinking water, sanitation, and electricity. Each \\nindicator is assigned a value of 0 or 1, with 1 indicating deprivation. To create a single index, the MPM \\ncombines the number of depriva tions, requiring a decision on the weighting of each indicator.

SATELLITE DATA AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MAPPING MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY  \\nPoverty statistics are typically compiled based on data collected from household surveys. However, \\nsample sizes of these surveys are typically not large enough to provide reliable estimates at more \\ngranular levels, and therefore resulting poverty estimates  may not be reliable at very granular \\ndisaggregation levels. Increasing sample sizes is a way to enhance reliability of survey estimates, but \\nit is often not practical as achieving such increases requires significant additional resources, which \\nare not rea dily available to NSOs or the organizations that conduct these surveys (Asian Development \\nBank (ADB), 2020) . An alternative method is the use small area estimation (SAE) techniques, in \\ncollaboration with development partners like the World Bank, by combining survey results with \\ncensus and other auxiliary data to produce more granular data.  \\nOn the other hand, there have been attempts to integrate beyond traditional types of data such as \\nthose coming from surveys and censuses. A good example is the use of satellite imagery for various \\ndevelopment indicators, and there are several reasons why i ts popularity is increasing. For one, \\nadvances in satellite -based socioeconomic measurements have led to an influx of high frequency data \\nfor both, data -rich and data -poor environments. One of these measurements is night -time light \\nintensity which has been  increasingly used following the initial works of (X. Chen & Nordhaus, 2011)  \\nand (Henderson et al., 2012) . This helped mitigate some of the known data shortcomings, including \\nthose of the SAE, if enhancing granularity is the main objective. Night -time light intensity can also be \\nused to estimate values in between surveys and enable nowcasting as well as help illuminate areas \\n', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/Satellite and artificial intelligence in mapping multidimensional poverty in AfricaA reviewstudy.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

However, using data on nightlights alone have several \\ndrawbacks. The data produced by satellites are top -coded which makes highly developed, urbanized \\nareas hard to differentiate. On the other side of the spec trum, the least developed areas often do not \\nhave measurable night -time lights, and this makes it difficult to obtain estimates for proxy measures \\nof socioeconomic development in such areas. Building on these developments, the use of daytime \\nsatellite imag es has started to become an important focus of research. (Xie et al., 2016)  showed that \\npoverty mapping using satellite imagery in combination with transfer learning and convolutional \\nneural networks (CNN) can lead to the predictive performance of survey data collected in the field. \\n(Jean et al., 2016)  trained a CNN to extract features in high -resolution daytime images using night \\ntime images as labels. The extracted features were used to predict asset wealth and consumption \\nexpenditure across five African countries. (Jean et al., 2016)  were able to provide that such a model \\nis strongly predictive of both average household consumption expenditure and asset wealth as \\nmeasured at the cluster level for countries where recent survey data is available. On the other hand, \\n(Head et al., 2017)  has proven that this method does not generalize in the same way that other \\nmeasures of development predict access to drinking water and a variety of health and education -\\nrelated indicators. It is possible to apply this method in other countries and contin ents given certain \\nlimitations. The study presented in this manuscript serves as a proof of concept in implementing the \\ntechniques used by (Jean et al., 2016)  using only publicly available satellite data that have lower \\nresolution and are readily available tools for data processing, akin to the objective of (Yeh et al., 2020)  \\nwhich used the same kind of satellite imagery to examine spatial distribution of economic well -being \\nin Africa.  \\nThere are many sources of nightlight intensity data. However, the best known and publicly published \\nare datasets based on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line -Scan System \\n(DMSP -OLS) and Suomi National Polar -Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer \\nSuite (SNPP -VIIRS) missions. Both were conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \\nAdministration (NOAA). It was decided that images from VIIRS will be used for this study because it \\noffered a substantial number of improv ements over Operational Line -Scan System as stated in the \\nwork of (Elvidge et al., 2013) . A cloud -free average radiance value was used to filter out the effects of \\nfires and other transitory events as well as irrelevant background, while unlit areas were set to zero.  \\nWhen combined with machine learning, high -resolution satellite imagery has proven broadly useful \\nfor a range of sustainability -related tasks, from poverty prediction; (Ayush et al., 2020; Blumenstock \\net al., 2015; Jean et al., 2016; Sheehan et al., 2019; Yeh et al., 2020)  to infrastructure measurement \\n(Cadamuro et al., 2018)  to forest and water quality monitoring (Fisher et al., 2018)  to the mapping \\nof informal settlements (Mahabir et al., 2018) . Compared to coarser (10 -30m) publicly -available \\nimagery (Drusch et al., 2012) , high -resolution (< 1m) imagery has proven particularly useful for these \\ntasks because it is often able to resolve specific objects or features that are undetectable in coarser \\nimagery. When combined with machine learning, recent work demonstrated an appr oach for \\npredicting local -level consumption expenditure using object detection on high -resolution daytime \\nsatellite imagery (Ayush et al., 2020) . showing how this approach can yield interpretable predictions \\nand also outperform previous benchmarks that rely on lower -resolution, publicly -available satellite \\nimagery (Drusch et al., 2012) .  \\n', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/Satellite and artificial intelligence in mapping multidimensional poverty in AfricaA reviewstudy.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

Sinc e 2014, Sentinel satellite series generate images \\nwith a spatial resolution of 10 meters. It is then possible to get remote -sensing data with a high time -\\nfrequency and a good spatial resolution (Jarry et al., 2021) . Researchers are turning to volunteer -\\ncurated geographic information and open geospatial datasets to study socioeconomic development, \\nsocial inequalities, and territorial conflicts (Gervasoni et al., 2018; Grippa et al., 2018; Mahabir et al., \\n2018) . One of the more popular geospatial data crowdsourcing platforms is OpenStreetMap (OSM), \\na global geospatial database containing billions of entries of volunteered geographic information, \\nmaintained by a massive community of mappers from around the world a ll working towards the goal \\nof curating accurate and complete geospatial data. The community of OSM contributors typically \\nconsists of individual mappers, university researchers, volunteer communities, and non -profit \\norganizations. Such organizations regu larly organize field mapping activities, workshops, and events \\nthat promote geospatial data mapping and contribution.  \\nThe combined use of coarse and fine spatial resolution remote sensing data is utilized to gain a deeper \\nunderstanding of human living conditions (Lin et al., 2019) . Coarse resolution satellite imagery, \\nwhich is readily accessible, frequently updated, and often free, offers a broad overview for large -scale \\ndecision -making (Lin et al., 2018, 2019) . On the other hand, fine spatial resolution remote sensing \\ndata, although less common and more costly due to commercialization, play a crucial role in \\naccurately identifying poverty (Duque et al., 2015; Varshney et al., 2015) . Despite their scarcity and \\nexpense, high spatial resolution data remain a more cost -effective alternative compared to \\ntraditional surveying methods (Zhao et al., 2019) . \\nRemote sensing imagery classification, a popular technique in land use/land cover studies, has been \\nintegrated with local expert knowledge and ontology to enhance the accuracy of poverty \\nidentification using remote sensing images (Kohli et al., 2015) . Adjusting thresholds for different \\nstudy areas is often necessary to ensure meaningful results (Kohli et al., 2015) , and post -processing \\nis required due to misclassifications (Lin et al., 2019) . Additional data layers from Geographic \\nInformation Systems (GIS) have been found to improve the performance of remote sensing -based \\npoverty classification by incorporating local knowledge and supplementary information (Kohli et al., \\n2013) .   \\nFor informal settlements, characterized by lower socioeconomic status, poor living conditions, and \\nunfavorable environments, the integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques has proven \\nadvantageous in identifying and understanding such communities (Kohli et al., 2016) . The \\nvegetation, impervious surface, bare soil method has been successfully applied to classify detailed \\nurban land use using very high -resolution remote sensing data, both in developed and developing \\ncountries (Herold et al., 2002, 2003; Kohli et al., 2016; Stoler et al., 2012; Stow et al., 2007; Stow et \\nal., 2010; Weeks et al., 2007) . Combining GIS and remote sensing techniques can enhance the \\ntemporal and spatial resolution of poverty identification. For instance, the integration of remote \\nsensing data with mobile operator Call Detail Records (CDRs) has shown potential in representin g \\nhuman living conditions, especially in urban areas (Steele et al., 2017) .

According to the United Nations Development Prog ramme's (UNDP) \\nMultidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which measures poverty across multiple dimensions, Africa \\nhas the highest level of multidimensional poverty in the world. In 2021, the MPI estimated that over \\n480 million people in Africa  (around 40% of the population) live in MP. The drivers of \\nmultidimensional poverty in Africa are complex and multifaceted, with factors such as conflict, \\nclimate change, inequality, and weak governance contributing to the persistence of poverty in many \\ncountries. The COVID -19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on poverty in Africa, \\nexacerbating existing vulnerabilities and pushing more people into poverty. Consequently, the need \\nfor mapping poverty still remains an issue. While most of the studies focused on African continent is \\nstill highly dependent on traditional approach, a number of studies have been seen to have adopted \\nthe geospatial and AI methodologies.  \\nSeveral studies have been conducted involving the application of Geospatial and AI technologies in \\nMP mapping in Africa. The challenges of designing poverty alleviation programs with tightening \\nbudgets was addressed by (Bigman & Fofack, 2000). Geographical  information systems (GIS) were \\nhighlighted for detailed poverty mapping, MP identification, and optimizing service delivery to the \\npoor. Household survey data combined with environmental variables from satellite imagery was \\nused to create poverty maps in Uganda, which reveals that combining household survey data with \\nsatellite imagery improves poverty predictions, highlighting the influence of environmental factors \\n(Rogers et al., 2006). Batana, (2013) applies the Alkire and Foster multidimensional poverty  \\nmeasures to estimate poverty among women in 14 Sub -Saharan African countries, revealing \\nsignificant differences across dimensions. Including additional dimensions alters country rankings, \\nwith rural areas experiencing higher poverty rates and lack of scho oling being a key contributor. \\nMarx et al.

The review suggests incorporating crowd -sourced \\ngeodata collection and spatial h ealth data infrastructures to deepen understanding of this complex \\nissue.

The findings reveal disparities \\nin water poverty between developed but water -scarce countries and lower -income water -rich \\ncountries. This study demonstrates the use of multidimensional po verty measures and geospatial \\nmaps to evaluate public health interventions, highlighting the prevalence and determinants of \\npoverty in Mozambique. Geospatial analysis of Nigeria's MP, focusing on Jigawa State reveals a \\ndynamic poverty pattern and highlight  the role of physical and natural resources in contributing to \\nthe state's high poverty rate (Gambo et al., 2022). Berenger (2019) examines poverty levels and \\ntrends in Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe using various poverty measures. The \\nfindings  emphasize the importance of considering both breadth and inequality components in \\nmultidimensional poverty analysis. Abeje et al. (2020) examines multidimensional poverty in three \\ndrought -prone agro -ecological settings in Ethiopia. The Alkire -Foster metho d and Correlation \\nSensitive Poverty Index (CSPI) are used to analyze poverty. The study emphasizes the need for \\ncontextualized indicators and location -specific approaches in poverty research and policy design. \\nBased on the study of (Jean et al., 2016), inv olving the application of the transfer learning approach \\nwithin 5 African countries, Malawi, Tanzania, Nigeria, Uganda, and Rwanda the out -of-sample R2 \\naccuracies obtained are 0.55, 0.57, 0.68, 0.69 and 0.75 respectively. Ayush et al. (2021) proposes a \\nreinforcement learning approach that combines low -resolution imagery with high -resolution \\nimagery to predict poverty in Uganda, achieving improved performance with fewer high -resolution \\nimages.  \\nHowever, a call for validation of the outputs over the African continent still remains a bone of \\ncontention. Using remotely sensed data to illustrate the nature of poverty in Africa based on the night \\nlight emission as a poverty indicator, Figure 1 shows t he Niger River Delta between Lagos (Nigeria) \\nin the West and Doula (Cameroon) in the East.

POTENTIAL PITFALLS IN MAPPING MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY IN AFRICA  \\nThe gaps identified from review of studies in mapping multidimensional poverty using geospatial techniques and artificial intelligence  (AI) in \\nAfrica, including:  \\n1. Lack of high -quality, spatially disaggregated data: Mapping multidimensional poverty using geospatial techniques and AI requires high -\\nquality data that are spatially disaggregated. However, in many African countries, data are often limited, outdated, or no t disaggregated at \\nthe local level, making it challenging to accurately map poverty across different dimensions.  \\n2. Limited understanding of the social and cultural context: Poverty is not only an economic phenomenon, but also a social and c ultural one. \\nTo accurately map multidimensional poverty, it is important to understand the social and cultural context in which pov erty occurs. \\nHowever, there is limited research on how social and cultural factors influence poverty in different regions of Africa.  \\n3. Ethical and legal considerations: The use of geospatial techniques and AI raises ethical and legal concerns related to privac y, data ownership, \\nand informed consent. More research is needed to understand how to ensure that the use of these techniques is et hical, transparent, and \\ninclusive.  \\n4. Limited focus on vulnerable populations: Mapping multidimensional poverty using geospatial techniques and AI should prioritiz e the needs \\nof vulnerable populations such as women, children, and ethnic minorities. However, there is limited research on how to effectively capture \\nthe experiences of these populations and to design interventions that are inclusive and equitable.  \\n5. Limited consideration of the intersectionality of poverty: Poverty is not experienced in isolation, but rather intersects wit h other social \\nidentities and experiences such as gender, race, and disability. Mapping multidimensional poverty using geospatial t echniques and AI should \\nconsider the intersectionality of poverty, but there is limited research on how to effectively do so. \\n', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/Satellite and artificial intelligence in mapping multidimensional poverty in AfricaA reviewstudy.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

CONCLUSIONS  \\nGeospatial mapping of poverty can be used to identify areas and populations that are most affected \\nby poverty, and to target resources and interventions where they are most needed. Poverty maps can \\nbe used to identify areas with high levels of multidimensi onal poverty and to prioritize the allocation \\nof resources and development projects to these areas. Geospatial mapping can also be used to \\nidentify the spatial patterns of poverty, such as the spatial concentration of poverty in certain regions, \\nurban -rura l disparities in poverty, and the links between poverty and environmental factors such as \\nland use and climate change. Furthermore, geospatial mapping can provide a valuable tool for \\nmonitoring and evaluating poverty reduction programs and policies. By tra cking changes in poverty \\nover time, geospatial mapping can help to assess the impact of poverty reduction programs and to \\nidentify areas where further interventions may be needed. Application of satellite data can provide a \\ncost -effective and automatic way  to estimate and monitor poverty rates at high spatial resolution, \\nespecially in countries with limited capacity to support traditional methods of data collection.  \\nApplication of AI in mapping MP can be seen is in the analysis of satellite imagery. Satellite imagery \\ncan be used to identify features such as housing, infrastructure, and vegetation, which can be used as \\nindicators of poverty. Machine learning algorithms  can be trained to analyze these features and to \\nidentify areas that are most likely to be affected by poverty. Natural language processing techniques \\ncan also be used to analyze text data, such as survey responses or social media posts, to identify \\nindica tors of poverty and to better understand the lived experiences of those affected by poverty. By \\nanalyzing these data sources, AI can provide a more refined understanding of poverty and its drivers. \\nAnother application of AI in mapping MP is in the developm ent of predictive models that can forecast \\nchanges in poverty over time. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns and trends, these \\nmodels can provide insights into the future trajectory of poverty and can inform the development of \\npoverty red uction strategies.  \\nThe integration of geospatial techniques and AI in mapping MP in Africa has the potential to provide \\nmore accurate and timely information for policymakers and development practitioners, and to \\ninform the development of effective poverty reduction strategie s. However, it is important to ensure \\nthat these techniques are developed and used in an ethical and transparent manner, and that they do \\nnot perpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities. There is also need for more research that \\naddresses gaps in mappin g MP using geospatial techniques and AI in Africa, in order to provide more \\naccurate and detailed understandings of poverty and to design interventions that effectively address \\nthe needs of the most vulnerable populations.  \\n7.

KEY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS  \\nIncome Poverty : focuses on assessing poverty based on income levels. It typically involves \\nestablishing a poverty line or threshold, below which individuals or households are considered poor \\n(Alkire & Foster, 2011)  \\nMultidimensional Poverty  (MP): Unlike income poverty, this measure takes into account multiple \\ndimensions of well -being and deprivation. It considers various aspects such as education, health, \\nhousing, access to clean water, sanitation, and other social and economic factors (World Bank,  2020)  \\nHuman Development Index (HDI):  Developed by (UNDP), the HDI measures poverty by \\nconsidering factors such as life expectancy, education, and income per capita. It provides a broader \\nassessment of development beyond income measures alone (Priambodo, 2021)  \\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) : is the intelligence of machines or software as opposes to the intelligence \\nof humans.  It is aapplied in analysing large amounts of data and to identify patterns and trends in \\nmultidimensional poverty.  \\nMultidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):  created by the UNDP and Oxford University , measures \\npoverty across multiple dimensions.  This approach uses a set of indicators that capture different \\ndimensions of poverty, such as health, education, housing, sanitation, and access to basic services. \\nThese indicators are combined to create a multidimensional poverty index (MPI) that measures the \\nextent of poverty in a given population (World Bank, 2018) . \\nMultidimensional Poverty Measure (MPM): an indicator that gauges the proportion of households \\nfacing deprivation across three dimensions of well -being: monetary poverty, education, and basic \\ninfrastructure services.  Unlike the MPI, the MPM includes the dimension of monetary poverty . \\n', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/Satellite and artificial intelligence in mapping multidimensional poverty in AfricaA reviewstudy.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

This study outlines a computational framework to enhance the spatial granularity \\nof government-published poverty estimates using a deep layer computer vision technique applied on \\npublicly available medium-resolution satellite imager y, household surveys, and census data from the \\nPhilippines and Thailand. By doing so, the study explores a potentiall y more cost-effective alternative \\nmethod for poverty estimation method.

INTRODUCTION \\n \\n When the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were officially launched in 2015, countries all over the world pledged to leave no one behi nd, with poverty eradication at th e top of the list. Included in the \\nGlobal Indicator Framework for monitoring prog ress on poverty reduction is the proportion of a \\ncountry’s population living below it s national poverty line, which is typically sourced from household \\nincome and expenditure surveys. Fr om the perspective of statistician s and other compilers of official \\npoverty statistics, the SDGs’ leave no one behind  principle which requires data  to be disaggregated by \\ngeographic location, ethnicity, ge nder, income class, and other rele vant dimensions, presents several \\nchallenges. Conventionally, household income and expenditure surveys have sample sizes that are \\nsufficient to provide nationally repr esentative poverty estimates, but not large enough to provide reliable \\nestimates at levels granular enough to meet all di saggregated data requirements of SDG 1. Moreover, the \\nsample sizes are inadequate in providing reliable  estimates at levels gr anular enough to allow \\ndevelopment planners efficiently target areas that need immediate poverty intervention.  \\n \\nIn addition to issues on granul arity, there are also concerns on timeliness and frequency of \\nrelease of updated poverty data. Conducting hou sehold income and expenditure surveys can be \\nexpensive and consumes a lot of time particularly in planning, executing and publishing results. This \\nmeans that in many countries, the lag time for the release of data is 1 year or more, depending on the \\ninformation being provided. However, financial reso urces from national governments and international \\ndevelopment organizations that suppo rt statistical programs such as conducting household income and \\nexpenditure surveys are limited and sparse (PARIS21 2017). Hence, it is important for national statistical systems to explore alternative cost-effective met hods of meeting the growing demand for SDGs and \\nother types of data for development.  \\n In 2017, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) desi gned a project which ai ms to strengthen the \\ncapacity of national statistics offices (NSOs) in th e Asia and Pacific region to meet the disaggregated \\ndata requirements of the SDGs using innovative data sources such as satellite imagery.  One component \\nof the project conducted a case study to examine the feasibility of using publicly accessible satellite imagery and computer vision techniques to enhance the granularity of poverty statistics compiled using \\nconventional estimation methods. Using publicly available resources is attractive for NSOs and development institutions who are planning to conduc t similar feasibility studies, as they serve as an \\nexcellent starting point to learn advanced machin e learning techniques without incurring significant \\nfinancial costs upfront.  \\n The method is applied using data from the Ph ilippines and Thailand. These two countries are \\ngood case studies as both are compiling small area  poverty estimates which provide enough data that \\ncan be used in the training of algo rithms capable of predicting poverty.  Both countries also have slightly \\ndifferent poverty profiles with Thaila nd having a lower prevalence of po verty. This variation allows for \\nthe examination of the impact of variability in the indicator of interest on the performance of an algorithm designed for imag e classification-related tasks. The stud y further contributes to the existing \\nliterature by examining robustness of the resulting es timates to user-specified  algorithmic parameters \\nand model specifications, which may serve as a means of strengthening confidence in poverty maps compiled through this in novative methodology. \\n  \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3785112', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ssrn-3785112.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

LITERATURE REVIEW \\n \\nAs briefly discussed earlier, poverty statistics are typically compiled based on data collected from \\nhousehold surveys. However, sample  sizes of these surveys are typica lly not large enough to provide \\nreliable estimates at more granular  levels, and therefore resulting po verty estimates may not be reliable \\nat very granular disaggregation levels. Increasing samp le sizes is a way to enhance reliability of survey \\nestimates, but it is often not practical as achiev ing such increases requires significant additional \\nresources, which are not readily available to NSOs  or the organizations th at conduct these surveys \\n(ADB 2020).  \\nAlternative methods to compile poverty statistics  to address some of th ese concerns are being \\nexplored. For instance, many countries have attemp ted to use small area estimation (SAE) techniques, \\nin collaboration with development part ners like the World Bank, by comb ining survey results with census \\nand other auxiliary data to produce granular stat istics. Conventional small area poverty estimation \\ntechniques have limitation which can often lead to increased model errors if the survey and census of population used were conducted years apar t . T o addr es s  t h is  er r o r , th e k ey i s  to  wor k  wit h  v ari abl es \\nwhose values do not change significantly over time. However, this approach may not always lead to a \\nbetter model as imposing such criterion limits the number of covariates that can be included in model-building and affect the model’s predictive performance.  Other limitations of the SAE include its inability \\nto address the issue of timeliness of statistics. If surveys and census data are not collected frequently, \\nthis will not lead to update d granular data even if SA E techniques are employed.  \\n On the other hand, there have been attempts to integrate beyond traditional types of data such \\nas those coming from surveys and censuses. A good example is the use of satellite imagery for various \\ndevelopment indicators, and there are several reasons why its populari ty is increasing.  For one, advances \\nin satellite-based socioeconomic measurements have le d to an influx of high frequency data for both, \\ndata-rich and data-poor environments. One of these measurements is nighttime light intensity which \\nhas been increasingly used following the initial wo rks of Chen and Nordhaus (2011) and Henderson, \\nStoreygard, and Weil (2012). This helped mitigate some of the known data shortcomings, including \\nthose of the SAE, if enhancing granularity is the main objective. Nighttime light intensity can also be used \\nto estimate values in between surveys and enable nowcasting as well as help illuminate areas that are less covered by surveys and censuses . However, using data on nightlig hts alone have several drawbacks. \\nThe data produced by satellites are top-coded which makes highly developed, urbanized areas hard to differentiate. On the other side of the spectrum, the least developed areas often do not have measurable \\nnighttime lights, and this makes it difficult to ob tain estimates for proxy measures of socioeconomic \\ndevelopment in such areas.  \\n Building on these developments, the use of daytime satellite images has started to become an \\nimportant focus of research. Xie et al. (2015) show ed that poverty mapping using satellite imagery in \\ncombination with transfer learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN) can lead to the predictive \\nperformance of survey data collected in the field. Jean  et al. (2016) trained a C NN to extract features in \\nhigh-resolution daytime images using nighttime images  as labels. The extracted features were used to \\npredict asset wealth and consumption expenditure across five African coun tries. Jean et al. (2016) were \\nable to provide that such a model is strongly predictive of both aver age household consumption \\nexpenditure and asset wealth as meas ured at the cluster level for countr ies where recent survey data is \\navailable. On the other hand, Head et al. (2017) has proven that this method does not generalize in the \\nsame way that other measures of development predic t access to drinking water and a variety of health \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3785112', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ssrn-3785112.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

It is possible to apply this method in other countries and continents \\ngiven certain limitations.   \\nThe study presented in this manuscript serves  as a proof of concept in implementing the \\ntechniques used by Jean et al. (2016) using only publicly available satellite data that have lower \\nresolution and are readily available tools for data processing, akin to the objective of Yeh et al. (2020) \\nwhich used the same kind of satellite imagery to ex amine spatial distribution of economic well-being in \\nAfrica. Whereas some of the follow-up studies that adopted similar techniques (e.g., Engstrom, Hersh, \\nand Newhouse 2017; Tingzon et al. 2019; Yeh et al. 20 20) focus in estimating the spatial distribution of \\nwealth, income, or poverty for years or areas that ar e not covered by convention al data sources, this \\nstudy focuses in predicting poverty in the same ye ar where conventional data  sources are available, \\nalbeit, providing more spatially disaggregated numbers. Furthermore, this study contributes to existing literature on using computer vision techniques to map the spatial dist ribution of poverty by examining \\nthe robustness of results to algorithmic tr aining parameters and specifications.  \\n   \\nIII.    DATA AND METHODS \\n \\nA. Reference Period \\n \\nOur target reference period coincides with the year s when small area poverty estimates are available—\\n2012 and 2015 for the Philippines an d 2013, 2015, and 2017 for Thailand . For the Philippines, we also \\nincluded 2018 even if small area poverty estimates have yet to be compiled and only provincial-level \\nsurvey estimates of poverty are available. Inclusio n of the 2018 data allows for the examination of \\nwhether the granularity of the indi cator to be used for training a machine learning algorithm has an \\nimpact on the extent of granularity at which predictions can be made.  \\n \\nB. Daytime Satellite Images \\n \\nPublicly accessible satellite images were used for th is study, particularly Landsat (15-meter resolution) \\nand Sentinel (10-meter resolution). Th e higher resolution of Sentinel is preferred, but since Sentinel was \\nlaunched in 2015, we had to use alternative source of satellite imagery.1 In particular, we use Landsat \\nsatellite images for 2012 and 2013, while Sentinel was used for all later years. The resolution of the satellites dictates the size of images that can be used  and the final resolution of artificial intelligence-\\nbased poverty predictions. The study used 256 pixel by 256 pixel images for La ndsat years and 384 pixel \\nx 384 pixel images for Sentinel years.  The research also tested smaller images (128 pixel by 128 pixel) for \\nThailand, but the CNN did not perform well.\\n2 However, Landsat’s 256 pixel by 256 pixel images \\nperformed well for CNN training. This provided a grid size of 3,840 m (15 meters per pixel multiplied by \\n256 pixels) at the equator. To reuse th e same grid for all years, we use 384 pixels for Sentinel images too.  \\nThis gave roughly 36,000 images in Thailand and 13 ,000 in the Philippines. In  succeeding analyses, the \\ncenter of each image was used as reference point wh en identifying which munici pality, city, province, or \\ntambon  (i.e., subdistrict) it belongs to. \\n \\n\\xa0\\n1  ESA Earth Online. https://earth.esa.int/web/gue st/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/sentinel-2. \\n2  The use of smaller-sized images inflates  CNN’s prediction errors by roughly 10%.  \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3785112', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ssrn-3785112.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='4 ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 629 \\nThe input data for this study was obtained using georeferenced and tagged image files sourced from \\nLandsat 8 and Sentinel 2. These image files were st ored as three-dimensional arrays, with each pixel \\nrepresented in red, green , and blue color bands.3 \\n \\nOne of the intermediate steps undertaken while preparing the satellite images was to collect \\ncloud-free daytime images that cove red the entirety of both the Phil ippines and Thaila nd. This process \\nentailed running an algorithm to select the best daytime images falling within an acceptable cloudiness or cloud cover during the period of th e study. Although it is ideal to set a low cloudiness threshold, setting \\nit too low could lead to having several areas with no image that satisfy the threshold. The cloudiness \\nthreshold was determined by expe rimenting until the algorithm pro duced a composite image for the \\nwhole country with the least amount of cloud cove r with adequate number of images to train on.\\n4 \\n The use of “pansharpening” was another intermed iate data preparation step undertaken to \\nenhance the resolution of the Landsat 8 images. Pans harpening combines high resolution panchromatic \\nimages (black and white but sensitive to colors) wi th lower resolution multispectral band images. The \\nprocess produces a single red, green, blue (RGB) colo r, multiband image at the higher resolution of the \\npanchromatic image. From the original 30-meter re solutions, pansharpening was able to produce 15-\\nmeter resolutions for the Landsat images.   \\nC. Nighttime Satellite Images \\n There are many sources of nightlight intensity data . However, the best know n and publicly published are \\ndatasets based on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line-Scan System (DMSP-OLS) and Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (SNPP-\\nVIIRS) missions.  \\nBoth were conducted by the National Oceani c and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It \\nwas decided that images from VIIRS will be used for this study because it offered a substantial number \\nof improvements over Operational Line-Scan System as  stated in the work of Elvidge et al. (2013).  \\n A cloud-free average radiance value was used to filt er out the effects of fires and other transitory \\nevents as well as irrelevant background, while unlit areas were set to zero.  \\nD. Sources of Poverty Data Used as Inputs  \\n \\nSince the main objective is to pred ict the proportion of a country’s population living below its national \\npoverty line using satellite imagery, the study need ed ‘ground truth’ data on  poverty for training a \\nmachine learning algorithm and validation.   \\nFor this purpose, the data used were the municipa l- or city-level estimates of proportions of \\npopulation living below the national  poverty line in 2012 and 2015  as compiled by the Philippine \\nStatistics Authority (PSA) using SAE technique. Th e SAE technique adopted by PSA combined data \\nfrom the Family Income and Expenditure Survey and Census of Population and Housing. The provincial \\n\\xa0\\n3  In principle, satellites have multiple  bands including infrared. Th is study focused on RGB color bands only because the CNN \\nhas been pretrained on regular RGB images  (through ImageNet). In addition, the ar tificial intelligence framework used in \\nthis study required .jpg files as input, which only support the RGB bands as well.   \\n4  We use Google Earth Engine’s built-in function for creatin g annual composite image based on a user-defined cloudiness \\nthreshold parameter. \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3785112', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ssrn-3785112.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

The small area poverty es timates for 2018 are not yet available at the time \\nthis study was conducted.   \\nIn Thailand, this study used the data compiled by  the National Statistical Office of Thailand \\nusing SAE technique applied on its Socioeconomic Survey and Census of Population. The poverty data \\nestimates were at the tambon  level for 2013, 2015, and 2017.  \\n For succeeding sections, mu nicipalities, cities, and tambons  are referred to as SAE-level areas \\nwhile provinces are referred as survey-level areas. Collectively, SAE-level and survey-level areas are \\ncoined using levels where government-published pove rty estimates are available. These terminologies \\nare used in succeeding sections.   \\nE. Shapefiles \\n \\nTo combine spatial datasets, tambon -level shapefiles for Thailand an d municipal- or city-level and \\nprovincial-level shapefiles for the Philippines were used. Thailand has more than 7,400 tambons while \\nthe Philippines have more than 1, 500 municipalities and ci t i e s  a n d  m o r e  t h a n  8 0  p r o v i n c e s .  O n  t h e  \\naverage, there are eight (4 kilome ter by 4 kilometer) images in a municipality and 152 images in a \\nprovince in the Philippines. In Thailand, there are five images in a tambon , on average.  \\n \\nF. Predicting Poverty Using Artificial Intelligence \\n \\nData from satellite images are inherently unstructured , noisy, and hard to process both statistically and \\ncomputationally. In recent years, CNNs have prope lled the field of computer  v i s i o n  f o r w a r d .  T h i s  \\ncreated opportunities to use computer vision on sa tellite images to gain information from the ground. \\n \\nSince the main objective of the study was to pred ict the prevalence of po verty at granular grid-\\nlevel using satellite imagery5, it was initially thought that directly linking poverty and daytime satellite \\nimages with computer visi on techniques would yield th e best results. However, poverty data with the \\ngranularity and frequency needed to train large neural networks was rare . To work around this issue, the \\nresearchers follow the approach  published by Jean et al. (2 016), as described below.  \\n First, the researchers trained a CNN to predict the intensity of night lights using daytime images \\nas input. In this study, the CNN was pretrained on ResNet-24 which has a deeper layer neural network \\nthan Visual Geometry Group's Face model which was used by Jean et al. (2016). A deeper later CNN \\ncould potentially capture more comple x features and enhance accuracy of  predictions. Intensity of lights \\nat night is commonly used as prox y for wealth and human interaction on the ground when working with \\nsatellite imagery (Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil 2012; Addison and Stewart 2015; Keola \\xa0, Andersson, \\nand Hall 2015). At this stage, the CNN learned to detect general features on daytime images, related to light intensity.\\n6 These features, or latent variables, can be used for other tasks, like estimating poverty \\nmeasures. The condensed image-based information can be averaged on a coarser level (i.e., from image \\ngrid level to a level where we have ground truth data ). To speed up the training, and reduce the amount \\n\\xa0\\n5  As explained earlier, the study examined different levels  of granularity and chose the level at which CNN performed \\nreasonably well. \\n6   The distribution of intensity of night lights is grouped into different clusters. Ideally, clusters are determined by a Gaus sian \\nmixture model with different nightlight ranges for each countr y-year combination. However, we also use heuristic methods \\nwhen Gaussian mixture model does not  produce satisfactory results.  \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3785112\", metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ssrn-3785112.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",

T h i s  i s  a  w e l l - k n o w n  t e c h n i q u e  a n d  referred to in the literature as transf er learning (Pan and Yang 2010).  \\n \\nSecond, the research team droppe d the prediction of nighttime light intensity and solely used \\nthe trained CNN as a function that  summarizes the complex multidimen sional input of image data into \\na single vector. This vector has 512 elements called “features” with a single feature vector per image. \\nThese features are a repr esentation of what the network dete cted on the image. These had several \\nadvantages over the raw pixel values , most notably that convolutional layers scan over the image using \\nkernels so that it does not matter where features will appear on the image. \\n To combine the grid-based image features with the SAE or survey-based poverty data, the team \\ntook the average value of each feature within the given SAE or survey areas. In the final training step, we used ridge regressions to examine the relationship between the image fe atures and. The trained CNN and \\nridge parameters were then used to predict image leve l poverty using only a daytime image as input. Finally, \\nwe examined whether the results depend on data splitting strategies and type of machine learning algorithm, a feat which has not been thor oughly explored in previous studies. \\n  Figure 1 summarizes the steps described above.   \\nFigure 1.

After preproce ssing and cleaning these data, Step 2 trains an algorithm to cl assify \\n(daytime) satellite images into different classes of night light intensity. Step 3 extracts the image features of the last laye r of the \\ntrained algorithm. In Step 4, the image features are averaged so  the spaces enclosed in grids correspond to the level at which \\npoverty-labelled images are available. These are regressed using th e target variable of the survey to find the relationship bet ween \\nfeatures and the target variable.

KEY FINDINGS \\n \\n \\nFor each country-year combination, we set aside 90%7 of the given SAE and survey areas for training \\nand 10% for validation. The training set is used for model parameter estimation while the validation set is used to assess the model’s predicti ve performance of the final poverty re sults. This is in addition to the \\nseparate validation of both the C NN and the ridge regression, that us e 10-fold cross validation to tune \\nhyperparameters and measure performance. The research  team also explored alternative data splitting \\nstrategies but as this section shows, the researcher s did not find significant differences in the results \\nwhen no other parameters were changed.  \\nA. Convolutional Neural Networks Validation  \\n For CNN training, the study team used ResNet 34 pretrained model on ImageNet database.\\n8 A weighted \\ncross entropy loss function is also used to mitigate imbalanced prediction classes. \\n \\nData augmentation is used for daytime images to  get more samples in the training dataset, in \\norder to get a model which generalizes better and to mitigate imbalanced classes in datasets. Specifically, vertical and horizontal flipping, random lighting, and contrast change with 10% probability, dihedral and \\nsymmetric warp are applied in order to enhance rela tively small datasets. During the experiments, the \\nteam found out that data augmentation was needed, as models suffered from significant overfitting. \\nThese types of augmentations were used because of their suitability for remote sensing images (Perez \\nand Wang 2017). \\n The study team also experimented with several parameters, such as lear ning rate, number of \\nepochs, and weight decay to optimize the CNN mo del. All experiments we re performed on Fastai \\nframework. \\n After validation of the top losses of CNN predicti ons, we found that using partly clouded images \\n(with semi-transparent clouds) is a challenge for C NN. For cloud removal on Sentinel images, a cloud \\nmasking technique was used. Howeve r, further cloud removal will be  needed for future research. \\n Table 1 shows the overall accuracy  of CNN predictions. Accuracy rate was computed by dividing \\nthe total number of images that were correctly classifi ed according to the class of  luminosity of night to \\ntotal number of images in  the validation dataset. \\n \\n     \\n\\xa0\\n7  Roughly 160 Philippine cities and municipalities in 2012 an d 2015, and 8 provinces in 2018 (or equivalent to approximately \\n1,500 images per year), were randomly selected to constitute  the validation set. On the other hand, about 700 tambons (or \\nequivalent to approximately 3,500 images per year) comprised the validation set in Thailand. \\n8  In this context, pretraining refers to using an algorithm that can already detect image features, such as lines, edges, etc. \\ninstead of developing an algorithm from scratch. The algorithm is trained on a wide range of images. Many features relevant \\nfor general image classification tasks overlap, regardless of the so urce of the image. The database used for pretraining in thi s \\nstudy, ImageNet, is regarded as a solid benchmark performer in computer vision predictions. \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3785112', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ssrn-3785112.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

As the Philippines \\nhas low and sparse nightlight values, it was easier for the model to correctly classify areas with low levels of intensity of nightlight class (Deng et al. 2009) wh ere no or only few man-made structures were visible \\nand therefore, easier to get higher prediction accuracy.  \\nB. Ridge Regression  \\n \\nAs explained earlier, prediction of night lights inte nsity is just an intermediate step in the method \\nadopted in this study. The main objective is to compile  estimates of poverty that  are more granular than \\ngovernment-published numb ers. To do this, the research te am leveraged on computer vision \\ntechniques, particularly CNN, to le arn features from satellite images that could be used to predict the \\nlevels of poverty in a specific area. Although dire ctly linking poverty and daytime satellite images with \\nCNN would probably yield the best results in line with this objective, poverty data with sufficient \\ngranularity needed to train a CNN model is uncommon. The intermediate  step taken was to first train \\nthe CNN to predict the intensity of night lights. This  was necessary because nigh t light images provided \\nmore labelled data where the model can be trained to group daytime satellite images into different \\nclusters with features asso ciated with different levels  of economic development.  \\n \\nAfter implementing the CNN, the next step in th e study was to extract th e features within the \\nsatellite images that were used in predicting the ni ght light intensity. This was done by modifying the \\nCNN such that it produced its last hidden layer as an  output instead of the regular output layer. In other \\nwords, instead of the classification based on intens ity of night lights, the study team extracted the \\nfeature vectors the CNN uses to dete rmine the intensity of night lights.  These data were aggregated by \\ntaking the element wise average values of the vect ors at the SAE or survey-area level. These were \\nregressed on the aggregated data using ridge re gressions. Ridge regression was chosen because \\ncompared to Ordinary Least Squares and other regre ssion modelling techniques, it had a better out-of-\\nsample predictive performance when the number of covariates was large. Further, ridge regression \\npenalized large model coefficients to shrink unimportant ones toward zero.9  \\n The results of ridge regression are summarized in  Figure 2. Using the root mean square error \\n(RMSE) as a metric, the study team observed higher out of sample errors for the Philippines  using 2018 \\ndata (Philippines 2018), presumably due to this specific country-year combination having a more \\naggregated poverty data used as input (i.e., provincial level) relative to other country-year combinations. \\n\\xa0\\n9  The study team experimented on excluding outliers, cutting the CNN at different points with different sizes of feature \\nvectors, and taking the logarithm of poverty but the results did not change dramatically. Alternative modeling strategies—such as random forest estimation, support vector regression, and others—can also be considered for future studies (Puttanapong et al. 2020). \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3785112', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ssrn-3785112.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

This means that even a very basic model can \\nproduce low RMSE values simply by predicting a va lue which is close to the average or mean poverty \\nrate.11  \\n Scatter plots may also be used as an alternat ive validation tool. In a scatter plot, each dot \\nrepresents one city and mu nicipality, province, or tambon . In the plots above, the x-axis contains the \\ngovernment-published poverty estimates while the arti ficial intelligence-based predictions are on the y-\\naxis. Despite Thailand having lower RMSE values than that of the Philippines, it can be observed that \\nartificial intelligence-based method  does not perform well in predicting higher levels of poverty rates. \\nThe estimated values for adjusted R\\n2 reaffirm this point. One possible reason for this is that there are \\nsignificantly more tambons  with low poverty rates than tambons  with poverty rates exceeding 20%.

Averaged Features versus Averaged Outputs \\n To derive artificial in telligence-based poverty rates on the sa me level where SAE or survey-based \\nestimates of poverty were used, tw o approaches could be considered. The first one comes from the ridge \\nregression training. The study team  used the averaged feature vector s and regressed them on published \\npoverty rates. With this model, the study could predict back the pub lished SAE and surv ey-level poverty \\nrates. The second approach comes from the image level estimates. In part icular, the trained ridge \\nparameters on the image level features were used  to get image level poverty rates. These were \\naggregated back to the SAE and survey level while controlling for gridded population.\\n12 In general, these \\ntwo approaches yielded almost th e same RMSE values (Table 2), suggesting that the choice of \\naggregation method was not very  critical in our study.  \\n  \\nTable 2.

Exploring Data Splitting Strategies \\n In this study, we originally set aside 90% of the given SAE and survey areas for training and 10% for \\nvalidation. This is in addition to the separate validation implemented for both the CNN and ridge \\nregression, which used tenfold cro ss validation to tune hyperparamet ers and measure performance. In \\nexisting literature, there is hardly  any agreement on the optimal allocation of splitting data between \\ntraining and validation (Xu and Goodacre 2018). The study team allocated 10% for validation (similar to Babenko et al. 2017; Sohnesen, Fisker, and Malmgren -Hansen 2019) because one of the input datasets \\nspecifically, the 2018 poverty rates in the Philippines had few data points.  Increasing the allocation for \\nvalidation would significantly reduce the amount of data  that could be used for training and therefore, \\nmay yield unreliable results.  Neve rtheless, the study team also expl ored alternative data splitting \\nstrategies. For the purpose of simplicity, we have reimplemented the methodology for only 1 year. As \\nshown in Table 3, we did not see any significant improvement in the predic tion accuracy when we \\nreduced the size of training set and increased the size of validation set. \\n    \\n\\xa0\\n12  Grid-level population estimates were separately estimate d following the method done by Stevens, et al.

Do Separate Models for Urban and Rura l Areas Improve the Prediction Accuracy? \\n \\nWhen we examined the results more closely by co mparing the artifical intelligence-based predictions \\nwith government-published estimates, we noted that  some of the pronounced differences between the \\ntwo sets of estimates were observed  in cities and highly urbanized ar eas with large ‘green spaces.’ For \\nsuch areas, the artificial inte lligence-based method tends to overestimate poverty rates than \\ngovernment-published estimates. Initially, we hypothes ized that the artificial intelligence model treats \\nthose green spaces as agricultural areas, and cons equently leads to higher  poverty estimates. To \\nexamine such hypothesis, we attempted to have sepa rate CNN models for urban and rural areas within \\neach country. This is slightly different from the or iginal approach that we adopted which trained images \\nfor urban and rural areas combined. The results sugge st that the prediction accuracy of CNN, when \\ntrained with urban area images only, declined furt her. On the other hand, the prediction accuracy of \\nCNN when trained with rural area images only was a pproximately the same as wh en we trained all urban \\nand rural area images together. In other words, we did not observe significant improvement in the \\nprediction accuracy by training CNN se parately for urban and rural areas.  \\n  D. Ridge Regression versus Random Forest Estimation  As discussed earlier, the second part of the adop ted method entails estimating a ridge regression on \\npoverty rates using the aggregate features extracted fr om CNN. In addition to ridge regression, we also \\nchecked how the results will change if random fore st estimation was used instead. Random forest \\nestimation is one of the most co mmonly used machine learning models due to its strengths. It has \\nprecise learning algorithms, operates  well on a large dataset, can mana ge thousands of input variables, \\nprovides estimates on variables that are critical in the classification, and it is capable of estimating \\nmissing data (Chakure 2019, Mwiti 2020).    \\nTable 4 summarizes the results of our comparis on of ridge regression and random forest’s \\npredictive performance. We present the results for onl y 1 year for simplicity. The results show that the \\nprediction accuracy for the training dataset dramatic ally improves when random forest estimation is \\nused. This is potentially driven by the ability of th e random forest’s modeling framework to yield very \\nprecise estimates from large sets of training da ta. However, when we co mpare the results for the \\nvalidation set, the difference between the ridge regr ession and random forest  becomes less remarkable \\nand we expect that it will be much less if the size of  validation set is increased further as random forest \\ntends to overfit the model onto the training datase t but may not necessarily perform as well using the \\nvalidation dataset. Hence, the result s based on ridge regression appear to  be more robust to the size of \\ntraining and validation datasets.  \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3785112', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ssrn-3785112.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

Harmonizing Artificial Intelligence-Based Predictions  \\nwith Published Poverty Rates \\n \\nIn the course of the research, th e team saw that the image-level poverty predictions generated from \\nemploying an artificial intelligence -based method when aggregated at  the same level of the published \\npoverty numbers, the data is not necessarily equal to the official poverty figures. From a practical \\nperspective, this could potentially create confusion among users of pove rty statistics in terms of which \\ndataset should be followed. To avoid caus ing confusion, governments can consider calibration methods.  \\n \\nIf it is a reasonable assumption to make that the survey-based or small area poverty estimates \\nare statistically reliable at the di saggregation level where these number s are published, the more granular \\nartificial intelligence-based predictions can be re scaled or calibrated such that, when they are \\naggregated at the same level where published poverty st atistics are available, th e two sets of estimates \\nare consistent. Adopting this strategy is appealing for co mpilers of official statisti cs as it avoids confusion \\nfor users who rely on official estimates but also use alternative data sources.  \\n Further, through calibration, the study team was able to address the unde restimation of poverty \\nin Thailand which may have been caused by the lack of variability in the input data.  \\n Figure 5 shows the distribution of artificial inte lligence-based poverty predictions that have been \\ncalibrated for the Philippines and Thailand.   \\nIf there would be concerns about the reliability of the survey-based  or small area estimates, the \\nuncalibrated artificial intelligence-based predic tions may be used as a point of validation.\\n14 When \\ndifferences between the uncalibrated predictions and the published estimates ar e small, there may be \\ncause to have increased confidence in the reliabilit y of the published estimates. However, where there \\nare nontrivial differences between  the artificial intelligence-bas ed predictions and the published \\nestimates, further investigation may be merited. In such context, furt her validation may entail consulting \\nlocal authorities and key stakeholders who have be tter appreciation of the socioeconomic realities on \\nthe ground.              \\n\\xa0\\n14  In general, there are several reasons why there could be concer ns about the reliability of an official statistic. In the case  of \\npoverty estimation, if the statistics are directly estimated fr om household surveys, there is a chance that the homeless or \\nthose who do not have permanent dwellings are not captured in such surveys. Simila rly, if census data are combined with \\nsurvey data to generate small area poverty estimates, it is  possible that the model has suboptimal predictive performance \\ndue to lack of covariates that are time invariant. \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3785112', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ssrn-3785112.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

DISCUSSI ON AND SUMMARY \\n \\nCan new sources of data, such as satellite images, which NSOs do not typically use when compiling development statistics, serve as a useful supplementary data sour ce in measuring the Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals?   \\nThis was the question that this study attempted to answer by looking at  poverty mapping using \\nsatellite imagery as a case study. The team leveraged on recent developments in computer vision techniques and publicly available earth observation data  available during the day and at night. With the \\nhigh costs associated with high resolution imager y, using publicly available satellite images may be \\nattractive to NSOs that are beginni ng to explore these innovative data sources and methods, and hence, \\ngreatly increase the applicability of the approach to other areas where NSOs are also working.  \\n In this study, data from satellite images were integrated with household income as well as \\nexpenditure surveys and censuses for two developi ng countries—the Phili ppines and Thailand. The \\nresults helped produce poverty maps that were more granular than exis ting maps based on conventional \\npoverty data sources. The methodological approach that was followed was inspired by deep machine \\nlearning techniques used by Jean et al. (2016). Th e results of applying this  methodology on specific \\ndatasets were encouraging. The use of publicly acce ssible satellite imagery, wh ose resolutions were not \\nas refined as proprietary images, still yielded predictions that were generally aligned with the government-published po verty estimates.  \\n Nevertheless, there are aspects of the adopted method which could be further improved.  For \\ninstance, it can be noted that the resolution of the input imagery has an effect on the quality of the outputs. Higher resolution imagery (i.e., Sentinel ’s 10-meter resolution versus Landsat’s 15-meter \\nresolution) was associated with be tter predictive performance. Hence, scaling up from exploratory \\nstudies to a more rigorous poverty mapping initiati ve would potentially benefit from high resolution \\nimagery that are commercially available and more sophisticated computing tools.  \\n Another key consideration is the granularity of input  data used in training the algorithm. In this \\nstudy, the team showed that for periods when small ar ea poverty estimates were available, the predictive \\nperformance was better than when input data fr om periods when only household income and \\nexpenditure surveys were available was used. This  was an important caveat for future research, \\nespecially when only household survey data are avai lable as input data for tr aining an algorithm.  \\n Further, validation of the results is warranted particularly for instances when the government \\npublished poverty estimates were sign ificantly different from the pred ictions produced by our adopted \\nmethod. For this purpose, it woul d have been ideal to conduct field validation and consult key \\nstakeholders through interviews or workshops. Howeve r, this activity was difficult as large gatherings \\nwere discouraged at the time of writing of this report, due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \\npandemic.  \\n To address this issue in this study, the study  team employed calibration methods under the \\nassumption that government-publishe d estimates provided an accurate picture of poverty at the level \\nfor which statistics are published (i.e., municipal,  city, or provincial level in the Philippines and tambon  \\nlevel in Thailand). In particular, the resulting machin e-learning predictions were rescaled or calibrated \\nsuch that, when the grid-level pred ictions were aggregated at the appropriate levels, they aligned more \\nclosely with the government-published numbers. The calibration method was designed to preserve the \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3785112', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ssrn-3785112.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

In practice, adopting this type of calibration \\nmay be appealing as it avoids confusion for users who traditionally rely on government estimates published by NSOs and other relevant government agencies. \\n Further, although it was found that the pred ictive performance of the adopted method was \\nbetter than a model which predicted poverty rates using only data from the intensity of night lights, combining the extracted image features with othe r granularly available da ta could improve on the \\nexisting predictions. For example, adding nightti me lights or other remote ly sensed information \\n(elevation, precipitation) or other types of readily available socioeconomic data can readily be tested \\nsince the image features can be thought of as latent  variables and can be adde d to analyses related to \\nwealth and poverty.   \\n Lastly, this study focused on examining the feas ibility of data integration—which entailed the \\ncombination of satellite imagery with surveys and census—and computer vision techniques to enhance \\nthe granularity of poverty estimate s compiled from conventional data  sources. Instead of enhancing \\ngranularity, other studies focused on predicting poverty or wealth for areas or years where conventional \\ndata for poverty estimation were not available. To test whether the methodolog ical principles discussed \\nin this paper still apply for such research objective, additional investigation may be needed. For instance, it is important to examine whether it is safe to assume that the relationshi ps observed for the years \\nwherein data are available are stable over time or not.  \\n \\n \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3785112', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ssrn-3785112.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",

These weights make it possible to label\\nthe individuals in the dataset according to the degree of\\npoverty: i) high, ii) medium or iii) low.\\nThe method starts by considering the initial dataset,\\nas a𝑛-by-𝑝matrix𝑌 = [𝑌𝑘𝑗], where𝑛is the number of\\nindividuals (n=429) and 𝑝the size of the selected feature\\nvector (p=99).\\nEach row of the matrix 𝑦𝑘= (𝑌𝑘1,...,𝑌𝑘𝑗,...,𝑌𝑘𝑝)gives\\nthe features of the 𝑘-th individual, while each column\\n𝑦𝑗= (𝑌1𝑗,...,𝑌𝑘𝑗,...,𝑌𝑛𝑗)gives the distribution of the 𝑗-th\\nfeature across individuals.\\nIt is important to note that the values of the 𝑌ma-\\ntrix are heterogeneous and can be ordinal, binary, or\\nnumeric. Matrix 𝑌is thus mapped into a deprivation ma-\\ntrix𝐺 = [𝐺𝑘𝑗]ofvaluesbelongingtotherange [0,1],with\\nbinary values associated to categorical features obtained\\napplyingproperthresholdsandcontinuousrealvalues\\nfor numeric ones. The mapping rules have been defined\\nby the domain expert. This expert knowledge permits todefine for each feature its deprivation level.

Thescorerepresentsthepovertyassociated\\nto each individual, so the higher the score, the more\\ndeprived the individual will be. However to better repro-\\nduce the reality, a vector 𝑣 = (𝑣1,...,𝑣𝑗,...,𝑣𝑝)of weights\\nshould be defined to properly consider the contribution\\nof each feature, where ∑𝑝\\n𝑗=1𝑣𝑗= 1and0 ≤ 𝑣𝑗≤ 1.\\nThusthe deprivation score 𝑐is obtained as:\\n𝑐 = 𝐺 ×𝑣⊤(1)\\nInsteadofdefiningasinglevectorofweights,following\\nLiberatietal.

It was\\nrevealed that with the adoption of AI tools, the process of poverty prediction has become, from one\\nside, quicker and more accurate and, from another side, more advanced due to the creation and\\npossibility of using different datasets. The originality of this work is that this is the ﬁrst sophisticated\\nsurvey of AI applications in poverty prediction.\\nKeywords: artiﬁcial intelligence; poverty; machine learning; deep learning; remote sensing; wealth\\n1. Introduction\\nAt the beginning of its emergence, AI was considered as a tool completely related\\nto the IT sphere; then, AI started being used widely in various ﬁelds to ﬁnd solutions to\\ndifferent types of problems. The economic sphere is no exception. AI tools have already\\nbeen commenced widely, and it is applied in predicting economic growth [ 1,2], enhancing\\ndevelopments in agriculture spheres [ 3,4], stock market predictions [ 5], etc. The application\\nof AI tools has not bypassed the poverty prediction ﬁeld.\\nPoverty is a phenomenon that does not have one unique deﬁnition. There are various\\napproaches in deﬁning and measuring poverty, but in general, all of them can be divided\\ninto two large groups: monetary and non-monetary approaches [ 6,7]. The ﬁrst and most\\nwidespread approach in poverty measurement is using a monetary approach: People are\\nconsidered poor when they do not have enough money to maintain their livelihood [ 8].\\nIn other words, poverty is measured by money: how much they earn or spend. In many\\ncountries as well as international organisations, poverty is measured using monetary\\napproaches [ 9]. However, the thesis of classifying poverty as only a money issue called into\\nquestions many researchers who afterwards developed approaches to deﬁning poverty.\\nThey claimed that poverty comprises a lack of opportunities, education, healthcare, and\\nSustainability 2022 ,14, 14238. https://doi.org/10.3390/su142114238 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Now, more and more researchers agree that poverty is a multidimensional\\nphenomenon that cannot be explained only by money. In order to measure and predict\\npoverty, various data started being applied to ﬁnd a more precise deﬁnition of poverty.\\nDifferent models have been created to ﬁnd a universal model that could be effective in all\\ncountries equally; however, models that were effective in one country can be ineffective in\\nother countries due to economical, social, and cultural discrepancies among countries [ 13].\\nIn order to measure and predict poverty rates, different econometric tools have been\\napplied: correlation analysis, regression analysis, factor analysis, panel data analysis,\\nand time series analysis. Since 2016, the integration of AI tools into the poverty prediction\\nﬁeld commenced [ 14]. Mainly, two major sub-classes of AI have been applied in poverty\\nanalysis: machine learning and deep learning. In early papers, AI models of poverty\\nprediction were compared with econometric models to ﬁnd out whether AI can be applied\\nin this sphere [ 13,15,16]. After obtaining persuasive results about the effectiveness of AI\\nmodels, as the next stage, different AI models were compared with each other to select the\\nbest model [ 17,18]. The strengths of AI models compared with econometric models are\\nthat they can deal with the multicollinearity issue, they have higher accuracy levels, higher\\ncalculation speeds, can work with big data, and require less human involvement [19,20].\\nIn poverty prediction processes, AI tools are applied not only for prediction itself\\nbut also for feature selection. Feature selection is also an important process in poverty\\nprediction, which implies selecting variables that can explain poverty [ 13]. In selecting\\nvariables, the signiﬁcance level of variable’s effect on poverty is analyzed, and the variables\\nwith high impact are selected to create models with them [ 15]. It is revealed that models\\nwith few but important variables can have higher accuracy levels [ 17]. In addition, creating\\nmodels with only a few variables will also make it easy to collect data for analysis and the\\nanalysis process itself. Before AI applications, econometric tools such as stepwise, LASSO,\\nand PCA analyses were applied for feature selection [21].\\nOne of the beneﬁts of AI tools is that different datasets can now be used in poverty\\nprediction. Traditional datasets of poverty analysis are survey and census data. Yet, only\\nthey are not enough for deﬁning poverty from various dimensions; thus, currently, remote\\nsensing data, call detail records, and e-commerce data have started being applied in poverty\\nprediction due to the capacity of AI applications in the extraction of necessary variables for\\nanalyses [22].\\nIn a relatively short span, AI tools have already been widely applied in poverty\\nprediction around the world. Although there are surveys conducted on explainable AI [ 23],\\nAI applications in drought assessment [ 24], the impact of AI on sustainability [ 6,25], and\\nhealth systems in resource-poor settings [ 26], to our knowledge, there is no comprehensive\\nsurvey that includes the available literature on utilities of AI in poverty prediction. Our\\naim is to ﬁll this gap by providing with an overview about the progress of AI application in\\npoverty prediction, as well as familiarizing the created AI poverty prediction models and\\ntheir outcomes. Therefore, we set the following research questions, answers to which will\\nprovide to reach our aim of writing this paper:\\n1. How many papers on utilities of AI in poverty prediction were published up until\\nMarch 2022?\\n2. Which approach to poverty was applied when AI was used for poverty prediction?\\n3.

In the paper, poverty was considered as a part of sustainability development,\\nand applied AI methods in poverty prediction were not discussed.\\nRef.

In addition, the author focused\\nonly on goals one, poverty reduction, and nine, industry, innovation, and infrastructure\\ndevelopment. In the paper, content analyses were conducted, and it was concluded that the\\nimplementation of AI in poverty mapping, agriculture, education, and ﬁnancial spheres\\nwould have a signiﬁcant impact on poverty reduction. Yet, in the paper, AI algorithms\\napplied for poverty prediction were not detailed.\\nRef. [ 29] collected and analyzed challenges and opportunities emerging from AI\\nin different disciplines. Moreover, a research agenda was created for each discipline,\\nand the utilisation of AI in delivering SDG was discussed. Although the paper contains\\ninformation on the impact of AI on poverty, AI methods applied in poverty prediction were\\nnot discussed.\\nFrom the above-mentioned literature reviews, it can be seen that there is a lack of\\nreview papers that analyze AI methods applied in poverty prediction and an absence of\\ndetailed survey paper on this topic. This served for us as motivation to ﬁll this gap and\\nconduct research based on research questions provided in Section 1.\\n3. Research Methodology\\nThis study is focused on AI applications in predicting poverty. Thus, the framework\\nof the research methodology (see Figure 1) was designed according to this purpose and\\nfollowing scientiﬁc guidelines [32]. The research methodology consists of four steps.\\n1. The ﬁrst step is a selection step that includes three important moments: time-frame,\\ndatabase, and keywords. As the ending point of the time-frame was selected as\\nMarch 2022 when our investigations started. We expected to ﬁnd results at the be-\\nginning of the time-frame. The origin of the paper was important when search-\\ning papers; thus, papers for our survey were selected from reliable Web of Science\\n(https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/ (accessed on\\n10 January 2022)) and Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/ (accessed on 15 January\\n2022)) databases. In order to properly conduct a search, Boolean operators were used\\nalongside with topic-related terms and phrases.For searching, the following keywords\\nwere used: “poverty and AI”, “poverty” AND “AI”, “poverty and machine learning”,\\n“poverty” AND “machine learning”, “poverty and deep learning”, “poverty” AND\\n“deep learning”. In this stage, overall, we collected forty-three papers.\\n2. The second step is a classiﬁcation. All found papers were classiﬁed according to\\nthe following exclusion criteria: (1) papers theoretically describing the relationship\\nbetween poverty and AI were excluded; (2) papers theoretically analyzing the impact\\nof AI on poverty were excluded; (3) papers illustrating examples of AI applications in\\nvarious spheres were excluded; (4) conference proceedings were excluded. The reason\\nof these exclusion criteria is that the aim of our survey is to analyze the real appli-\\ncations of AI methods in poverty prediction. After reading abstracts and full-length\\npapers, twenty-two papers were selected for our survey. Among these twenty-two\\npapers, the remaining steps were performed. This classiﬁcation step provided us with\\nthe beginning of the time-frame of our survey. It was revealed that the ﬁrst paper\\non AI applications in poverty prediction was published in 2016; thus, this year was\\nchosen as the initial benchmark of the time-frame of our conducted survey.\\n3. In the third step, the content of collected papers was analyzed.\\n4. At the last stage, the outcomes were discussed and future orients were provided.', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Combining Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning to Predict Poverty (CSIMLPP)\\nThis work is a revolutionary study in predicting poverty from high-resolution satellite\\nimagery [ 14]. As poverty measurements, consumption expenditure and asset wealth were\\nchosen. Analyses were conducted using satellite data, and the Living Standards Mea-\\nsurement Study surveys ﬁve countries: Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda.\\nTo measure household expenditures, authors used Living Standards Measurement Study\\n(LSMS) surveys, whereas for wealth measurement, they used an asset index drawn from\\nthe Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Both these indicators were outcomes of\\nthe model.\\nAuthors applied the CNN model, which consisted of three stages. Firstly, the model\\nwas pretrained on image classiﬁcation data set (ImageNet). Next, CNN was trained to\\npredict the nighttime light intensities corresponding to input daytime satellite imagery.\\nFinally, cluster-level expenditures or assets were estimated. To extract features for the CNN\\nmodel, convolutional ﬁlters and features corresponding to urban areas, nonurban areas,\\nwater, and roads were applied.\\nAs an assessment of the model, the coefﬁcient of determination ( R2) was applied.\\nFrom the results, the predictive power for assets (55% to 75%) was higher than for household\\nconsumption (37% to 55%).\\nThe authors compared their own model with a model where nightlights were the only\\ninput, and their model outperformed the latter for all countries.\\nThey also revealed that their model worked better than the approach of using data\\nfrom past surveys to predict outcomes in more recent surveys. In addition, they applied\\ntheir model trained for one country in another country. As expected, in-country trained\\nmodels performed better than out-of-country models, but the accuracy of out-of-country\\nmodels was close to the in-country ones.\\nIn conclusion, it should be noted that this study inspired many researchers illustrating\\nthe possibility of using daytime satellite imagery in poverty prediction.', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

Remote Sensing-Based Measurement of Living Environment Deprivation: Improving Classical\\nApproaches with Machine Learning (RSBMLED)\\nThis paper contributes to poverty measurement in urban areas by using high spatial\\nresolution imagery data [ 15]. As poverty measurement Living Environment Deprivation\\n(LED) was applied. The LED index is a part of the English Indices of Deprivation, which\\nmeasures the quality of the local environment in terms of the quality of housing and\\nthe quality of the surrounding environment, and it consists of four indicators: housing\\nin poor conditions, houses without central heating, outdoor air quality, and road trafﬁc\\naccidents [33].\\nAn analysis was conducted for Liverpool (UK), where four sets of variables were\\nextracted from a very high spatial resolution (VHR) image downloaded from Google\\nEarth: a set of land cover features, a set of spectral features, a set of texture features,\\nand a set of structure features. Land cover features illustrate different types of land cover:\\nsoil, vegetation, orange impervious surfaces (clay tile roofs and similar), gray impervious\\nsurfaces (asphalt and industrial rooﬁng), water, and shadow. Spectral features represent\\nthe summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) of pixel values inside objects [ 34].\\nTexture features identify the spatial distribution of intensity values in the image, thus\\nconveying information on uniformity and contrast [ 34]. The randomness of the distribution\\nof the spatial arrangement of elements inside the polygons is characterized by structure\\nfeatures [34–36].\\nThe authors used Google Earth images, combined them as a mosaic into geographic\\ncoordinates, and then projected this mosaic onto the same coordinate system of the spatial\\ndatabase of deprivation indices of Liverpool to obtain a georeferenced image with a pixel\\nsize of 70 cm. They used it as an input to calculate image-derived features for the same\\nspatial units for which the LED index was reported.\\nOne of the contribution of the paper is to create a model for estimating LED index,\\nwhich was represented by formula LED =f(LC;SP;TX;ST), where f()is a function of\\nland cover (LC), spectral (SP), texture (TX), and structure (ST) data combination from each\\narea and produces a prediction of its LED index. As input variables, the authors used\\nsub-variables of these four sets of features: eight from a set of land cover features, six from\\na set of spectral features, eleven from a set of texture features, and ten variables from a set\\nof structural features.\\nIn the paper, the performance of two econometric models (Ordinary Least Squares Re-\\ngression (OLS) and a Spatial Lag model (SL) based on the generalized method of moments)\\nwas compared with the performance of two machine learning methods: Gradient Boost\\nRegressor (GBR) and random forest (RF). A hundred trees were grown for each RF and\\nGBR model.\\nIn model evaluation, the coefﬁcient of determination ( R2) was applied. In evaluat-\\ning models, the authors used two approaches: naïve ( R2) and honest (based on cross-\\nvalidation [ 37]). In both naïve and honest approaches, machine learning methods were\\nbetter, and RF was the best model. In the naïve approach, R2was 0.94 for RF and 0.83 for\\nGBR models, whereas for OLS, this indicator was 0.34, and for SL it was 0.43. However,\\nafter implementing the honest approach, when authors conducted cross-validation (repeat-\\ning the split-train-test procedure 250 times in each iteration), the R2for machine learning\\nmethods decreased dramatically from 0.94 to 0.54 for RF and from 0.83 to 0.5 for GBR. Yet,\\nin the OLS model, the decrease comprised only 0.04 from 0.34 to 0.3.\\nAnother contribution of the paper is in feature selection. Authors from all models\\nconcluded that the percentage of vegetation and the percentage of water had high pre-\\ndictive performance. Yet, it was claimed that the application of similar variables in other\\ncities might result in different results with respect to the signiﬁcance of variables; thus,\\nthe peculiarity of the city should be taken into account.\\nOverall, it can be said that AI tools performed better in comparison to economet-\\nric models.', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

Monetary and Non-Monetary Poverty in Urban Slums in Accra: Combining Geospatial Data\\nand Machine Learning to Study Urban Poverty (CGDMLUP)\\nThe paper proposes a methodology of slums identiﬁcation and poverty rate prediction\\nin urban areas by applying a combination of different data and machine learning tools [ 27].\\nThe poverty rate at the neighborhood level was calculated using the small-area poverty\\nestimation methodology [38].\\nThe analysis was conducted for Accra city (Ghana) using three data types: household\\nsurvey data, population census data, and geospatial data. As an imagery dataset an image\\nmosaic of Quickbird-2 multispectral (Blue, Green, Red, and Near-Infrared) of the AMA\\n(Accra Metropolitan Assembly) with a spatial resolution of 2.44 m was used. From this\\nimagery, seven spatial and spectral features, representing the variability within the Enu-\\nmeration Areas [ 39], were calculated for analyses. These features are the following: Line\\nSupport Regions (LSR), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Linear Binary Pattern Mo-\\nments (LBPM), PanTex, Fourier Transform (FT), the normalized difference vegetation index\\n(NDVI), and the mean of the four original bands (Blue, Green, Red, and Near Infrared).\\nAfter data collection, the work was performed in three stages. Initially, the slum index\\nwas constructed by applying the random forest method, and the output was compared\\nwith ofﬁcial slums deﬁned by UN-Habitat [ 40]. For this analysis, the same variables as in\\nthe UN-Habitat were used as input variables, adding population density and elevation\\nexplanatory variables. Elevation data were estimated by applying a Digital Elevation\\nModel (DEM). Sub-samples of 50 % data were randomly selected 100 times from the total\\nsample to calculate a slum score. Next, the slum index map was created. Furthermore,\\nthe model conducted feature selection, and the results showed that variables representing\\nslum index signiﬁcantly include elevation, population density, and the number of people\\nper house.\\nAt the second stage, the poverty rate at the neighborhood level was estimated. To esti-\\nmate the poverty rate, population density and geospatial variables were used with the data\\nof the 2010 Population and Housing Census and Ghana Living Standards Survey Round Six\\n(GLSS 6). Overall, the variables represented four levels of the investigating area: household\\nlevel, enumeration areas level, neighborhood level, and geospatial level. During model\\nselection, a two-step procedure was conducted. Firstly, feature selection was conducted\\nusing a LASSO estimator with Bayesian shrinkage, according to which 15 variables were\\nselected. Next, relying on the stepwise procedure, the ﬁnal model was selected, where the\\nselection criteria included the p-value. In addition, a poverty map was also created.\\nAt the last stage, correlation and regression analyses between the slum index and\\npoverty rate were conducted. Three different regressions were conducted, where the\\ndependent variable was the poverty rate at the neighborhood level, and independent\\nvariables were household-head characteristics. The difference between the regressions is\\nthat the ﬁrst regression used a slum index generated by random forest as an independent\\nvariable, whereas ofﬁcial slum data (slum areas) were used as an independent variable in\\nthe second regression. In the last regression, elevation was included as an independent\\nvariable to identify the concentration of poor people in low elevated areas.\\nFrom the results, it was revealed that a high level of women fertility, high monetary\\npoverty, and poor school attendance were strongly associated with living in the slums of Ac-\\ncra. Furthermore, more poor people were concentrated in the lower-elevation areas, which\\ncould be explained by the fact that these areas were ﬂood-prone. Other important variables\\nexplaining long-term poverty were ethnicity, religion, and region. Representatives of ethnic\\nmajorities tended to work in the manufacturing sector, whilst ethnic minorities and new\\nmigrants in poorer slum communities were employed in the wholesale sector. Generally,\\nthe outcomes illustrate various economic opportunities among slum communities.', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

An Empirical Assessment\\n(IRFSMPP)\\nThe contribution of the paper that it proposes random forest algorithm applications\\nfor selecting model and predicting poverty status [ 13]. Poverty was deﬁned as monetary\\npoverty based on consumption expenditure aggregates. In poverty measurement, poverty\\nproxies [41] were applied.\\nThe household data of six countries (Albania, Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania,\\nand Uganda) were used to conduct analysis, which included the following sections: demo-\\ngraphics, education, food consumption, nonfood consumption, housing quality, ownership\\nof durable goods, employment, and location.\\nIn the paper, the traditional econometric model—Multiple Imputation (MI) [ 39]—was\\ncompared with a machine learning method—random forest (RF)—to identify which model\\ncould predict better. In constructing the RF model, standard settings were used. Five\\nhundred trees were grown with a minimum of four observations in each leaf. Moreover,\\nin the paper, steps involved in conducting the RF model were described precisely. Overall,\\nin the paper, six models were created: MI with Stepwise variable selection, MI with LASSO\\nvariable selection, RF using Entropy loss function, RF using Gini impurity loss function,\\nMI with 25 variables based on importance score from RF, and RF with 25 variables based\\non an importance score from RF. Models were assessed by applying the mean square error\\n(MSE) between predicted and measured poverty rates.\\nThe analysis process of the research consisted of two parts. Firstly, the data for one\\nyear were used. It was divided randomly into two parts, and half of the data were used\\nfor model generation, which was then tested in the second half of the data. Next, the same\\nwork was conducted, however, using the data for two years, where the ﬁrst year was\\nused for model creation and the second year served to assess the prediction capacity of\\nthe model.\\nIt was revealed that the accuracy level of poverty prediction was higher when using\\nRF. The poverty was calculated in three levels (urban, rural, and national), and results\\nindicated that in urban and rural levels, the RF worked better rather than in the national\\none. When creating a model for one year, in urban and rural levels, RF had signiﬁcantly\\nhigher accuracy in four out of six countries.\\nYet, when making predictions for two years, all models were not accurate enough,\\nand only about half of the models could predict poverty accurately. It was revealed that\\na consequence of the potential aging of the sample is an additional inaccuracy. Large\\nvariations in predictions for different models indicated that some models were incapable of\\ntaking price and economic changes into account.\\nIn feature selection, Stepwise and LASSO methods were applied [ 21], and their outputs\\nwere compared with RF results, which also had an option of using importance scores for\\neach variable. So, Stepwise and LASSO methods on average selected 81 and 132 variables,\\nrespectively, for six countries, whereas according to RF, 25 variables had the highest\\nimportance score. Prediction models were constructed based on variables, selected by RF.\\nWhen the MI prediction model was constructed by relying on these 25 variables selected by\\nRF, its accuracy improved in four out of six countries. The average accuracy for all models\\nwas also better with 25 variables.\\n4.5. Multidimensional Paths to Regional Poverty: A Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis\\nof Colombian Departments (FSQCACD)\\nThe objective of the paper is to evaluate conditions that affect the capability deprivation\\nof twenty-four Colombian regions [ 42]. In order to measure capability deprivation, two\\nindicators were applied: monetary poverty (MP) and life expectancy (LE). Conditions\\nimpacting capability deprivation include economic (trade openness and GDP per capita),\\ninstitutional (internal displacement and transparency), and social conditions (education\\ncoverage).', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Sustainability 2022 ,14, 14238 10 of 39\\nTo achieve their aim, authors applied a Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis\\n(fsQCA). The strength of this method is that it can be applied even to small-sized samples,\\nand the consolidated effect of a set of conditions can be assessed. The fuzzy sets in the paper\\nwere designed using ﬁve conditions and two outcomes (MP and LE). Boolean comparison\\nof cases was conducted in the paper in terms of the absence or presence of certain conditions.\\nYet, the partial membership to a fuzzy set could occur which demanded the calibration\\nprocess. In order to deﬁne full absence and full presence, the 10th and 90th percentiles\\nwere used as cutoffs, whereas the point of maximum ambiguity was determined using\\nthe median.\\nIt was revealed that although there were attributes impacting on outcomes, none\\nof them reached the 0.9 cutoff, meaning that no attribute played a determinant role in\\nthe presence of MP and LE. The most impactful attribute on MP was GDP per capita,\\nwhilst on LE, it was displacement. In the sufﬁcient condition analysis, two methods were\\ninvestigated: which conﬁgurations led to the presence of capability deprivation and which\\nconﬁgurations led to the absence of capability deprivation. The authors illustrated four\\npathways to high regional MP and two pathways to low regional MP , whereas for LE, they\\nrepresented three pathways for high LE and three pathways for low LE. This technique\\nempowered the classiﬁcation of regions with respect to pathways.\\nFinally, a general model was developed, which included all possible conﬁgurations\\nthat could explicate high MP rates in regions. The model’s score of consistency comprised\\n0.9, implying its interpretation’s robustness. It should be noted that there was no univer-\\nsal pattern that could be applied to all high MP regions, yet economic and institutional\\nattributes were important in deﬁning MP .\\nIt can be concluded that the application of fuzzy set provides a deeper analysis of\\npoverty by offering different combinations of attributes, which may lead to increasing or\\ndecreasing poverty rates. From this study, it can be seen that even for different regions of\\none country, there is no universal pattern explaining poverty.\\n4.6.Retooling Poverty T argeting Using Out-of-Sample Validation and Machine Learning (RPTOVML)\\nThe aim of this paper is to improve the proxy means testing (PMT) tool to identify poor\\npeople for social program targeting [ 16]. The main problem in targeting is the existence of\\nleakage and undercoverage rate, and authors aimed at improving poor people identiﬁcation\\nfrom out-of-sample data. In addition, the goal of PMT is not only to categorize poor people\\nbut also to ﬁnd signiﬁcant variables characterizing poverty that would perform well in any\\ndata and country.\\nLSMS data and household surveys of Bolivia (2005 year), Malaawi (2004–2005 years),\\nand East Timor (2001 year) were used for analysis. The sample data had different sizes\\namong these countries; in particular, Malaawi had the largest number of observations\\n(11,280), whereas this ﬁgure comprised 4086 for Bolivia and it was 1800 for East Timor.\\nYet, for these countries, the variables were not similar: household characteristics had\\nsome discrepancies.\\nIn the paper, the USAID poverty assessment tool [43] was applied, and two methods\\nwere compared, econometric (cross-validation) and machine learning (stochastic ensemble\\nmethods [ 44]), to identify which of them would be more accurate. Authors used PMT\\ntools developed by the University of Maryland Institutional Reform and Informal Sector\\n(IRIS) Center to demonstrate methods for USAID poverty assessment. In evaluating PAT\\ntools, the following metrics were used: total accuracy, poverty accuracy, undercoverage\\nrate, leakage rate, and balanced poverty accuracy. Balanced poverty accuracy penalizes the\\npoverty accuracy rate with the extent to which the leakage and undercoverage rates exceed\\none another.\\nIn stochastic ensemble methods of machine learning, the following algorithms were\\napplied: regression tree, random forest, and quantile regression forest. It was emphasized\\nthat the quantile approach is particularly useful for investigating poverty; in other methods,', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

Five\\nhundred trees were grown for each algorithm.\\nAuthors compared results from replicating IRIS models, cross-validation, and stochas-\\ntic ensemble methods for three countries according to the total accuracy, poverty accuracy,\\nundercoverage, leakage, and balanced poverty-accuracy indicators. It was revealed that\\ncross-validation and stochastic ensemble approaches were prompt in classifying non-poor\\nas poor. In particular, authors found that the application of cross-validation and stochastic\\nensemble methods to the problem of developing a poverty-targeting tool could produce a\\ngain in poverty accuracy, a reduction in undercoverage rates, and an overall improvement\\nin balanced poverty accuracy criterion in comparison to traditional methods.\\n4.7. Machine Learning Approach for Bottom 40 Percent Households (B40) Poverty Classiﬁcation\\n(MLB40)\\nThe aim of this paper is to select the best model for the precise identiﬁcation of the\\nbottom 40 percent of households (B40) in Malaysia [ 17]. The national poverty line based on\\nincome served for poverty measurements.\\nNational Poverty Data Bank, called ‘eKasih’ was used as a dataset [ 45]. From this\\ndataset, the authors used information on 99,546 households of three states, namely Johor,\\nPahang, and Terengganu. Overall, 15 variables were used: state, area, strata (urban/rural),\\nethnic, marital status, age, gender, job, education, type of ownership, household number,\\ntotal income, income per capita, date of record, and poor status.\\nAuthors applied Naive Bayes [ 46], Decision Tree (J48 classiﬁer, based on the C4.5\\nalgorithm) [ 47], and k-Nearest Neighbors [ 48] algorithms for their purpose. The classi-\\nﬁcation performance of models was analyzed using Classiﬁcation Accuracy and Kappa\\nStatistic [49].\\nBefore creating models, data pre-processing tasks were conducted with respect to\\nthe raw dataset to ensure the quality of the training data. These data pre-processing\\ntasks include cleaning [ 48], feature engineering, normalisation [ 50], feature selection [ 51]\\n(Correlation Attribute, Information Gain Attribute, and Symmetrical Uncertainty Attribute),\\nand sampling methods using SMOTE [52].\\nThe ﬁrst step of the pre-processing task is data cleaning, when missed variables were\\nreplaced. Next, feature engineering was conducted. A new variable, such as Median\\nMonthly Income, was created by dividing the total income to 12. Then, a pre-labelled class\\nfor B40 was manually generated, relying on thresholds for each state. Here, two classes\\nwere created: B40 and not-B40. The third step was conducting a normalisation procedure\\nfor certain variables, making them fall between 0 and 1. Fourthly, a feature selection\\nprocedure was conducted by applying three ranking methods: Correlation Attribute,\\nInformation Gain Attribute, and Symmetrical Uncertainty Attributes. According to all\\nthree ranking methods, the top-eight variables are: state, area, ethnic, household number,\\ntotal income, average monthly income, income per capita, and date of record. As the ﬁnal\\nstage, the selection of the sampling method was conducted. The problem with dataset\\nwas that there was an imbalance between B40 (majority—94,495 households) and not-B40\\n(minority—5051 households), with a ratio of 5:95. This could lead to biases towards the\\nmajority class. In order to overcome this problem, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling\\nTechnique (SMOTE) was applied, when synthetic minority examples were generated to\\noversample the minority class. SMOTE is then applied to the dataset at 400% over sampling\\ndegrees with nearest neighborhoods numbering at ﬁve, increasing the minority class\\nfrom 5051 to 25,255 instances. So, after sampling, instead of 99,546 instances, there were\\n119,750 instances, and the imbalance ratio comprised 21:79.\\nAfter pre-processing procedures, each classiﬁer was then optimized using a different\\ntuning parameter with 10-Fold Cross Validation for achieving the optimal values before\\nthe performance of the three classiﬁers were compared with each other. For Naïve Bayes,\\ndiscretization was used as a tuning parameter. For the decision tree, minimum numbers of\\nobjects [ 53] and conﬁdence factor [ 47] (from 0.1 to 1.0 by an increment of 0.2) were used as', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

For the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, the k-value was investigated\\nfrom 1 to 10 to identify the optimal value for the training samples [ 54]. In addition, four\\ndistance functions were examined in the tuning process: Euclidean distance, Chebyshev\\ndistance, Manhattan distance, and Minkowski distance [55].\\nModels were created twice: initially, 16 variables are used and then 8 top signiﬁcant\\nvariables are used. Interestingly, the outcome was more accurate in the latter case (the\\naverage accuracy increased from 93.35–95.76 %).\\nMoreover, authors represented results with models before tuning and after tuning\\nparameters. For Naïve Bayes, after discretization, the accuracy level increased from 91.52–\\n97.27 %. For the decision tree, the optimal value of the conﬁdence factor was 0.4 (accuracy\\nlevel was the highest—99.27). An increase in the minimum number of objects decreased the\\naccuracy; thus, the optimal value for the minimum number of objects parameter was chosen\\nas 2. For the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, a k-value was chosen as 1, and the Manhattan\\ndistance was used as a distance function for the best and most accurate performance. When\\ncomparing models, according to both Classiﬁcation Accuracy and Kappa Statistic, the\\ndecision tree performed with the highest accuracy (99.27% and 0.98), whereas the least\\naccurate model was the k-Nearest Neighbor (96.80% and 0.90).\\n4.8. A Comparison of Machine Learning Approaches for Identifying High-Poverty Counties:\\nRobust Features of DMSP/OLS Night-Time Light Imagery (NTLIML)\\nThe aim of this study is to illustrate that with the help of only DMSP/OLS, night-\\ntime light-imagery machine learning can identify robust classiﬁcation features as well as\\nhigh-poverty counties [ 18]. For poverty identiﬁcation, 15 features were extracted from\\nnighttime light imagery and trained with 96 high-poverty counties and 96 non-poverty\\ncounties in 2010. These 15 features can be considered from three aspects: central tendency\\n(four features), degree of dispersion (three features), distribution features (seven features),\\nand spatial feature (one feature). In order to decrease discrepancies, a modiﬁed invariant\\nregion (MIR) method was applied to desaturate the image [56].\\nIn the paper, 2554 counties of 31 Chinese provinces were studied. To reach the\\naim, seven models were applied: Gaussian process with radial basis function kernel\\n(GPRBFK) [ 57], stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) [ 58], partial least squares regression\\nfor generalized linear models (PLSRGLMs) [ 59], random forest (RF) [ 60], rotation forest\\n(RoF) [ 61], support vector machine (SVM) [ 62], and neural network with feature extraction\\n(NNFE) [63].\\nClass probabilities (0 1) were acquired during classiﬁcation; then, a threshold was\\nselected as the cut-off between the two classes (when the probability was closer to 1, it\\nimplied a higher probability of the county being poor) [ 64]. Counties were considered as\\nhigh in poverty when the probability of their poverty was larger than 0.6.\\nFive feature importance measures were adopted to evaluate feature importance levels\\nfor the seven machine learning approaches. In RF, mean decrease Gini and permutation\\naccuracy importance were applied for feature importance measurements; in RoF, the sum\\nof the decrease in impurity was used; in SGB, the sum of squared error was used, whereas\\nthe remaining models used a receiver operating characteristic curve.\\nThree types of accuracy were used to measure the classiﬁcation’s accuracy: user’s\\naccuracy, producer’s accuracy, and overall accuracy. The user’s accuracy and producer’s\\naccuracy both exceeded 63%, which indicates that all machine learning approaches provide\\naccurate identiﬁcation results, which is also supported by the fact that all overall accuracies\\nwere greater than 82%.\\nThe classiﬁcation performance of each machine learning approach was different.\\nIn total accuracy, GPRBFK had the highest accuracy level (84.67%), whereas PLSRGLM had\\nthe lowest accuracy level (82.85%).\\nOverall, from all different applied methods, it was revealed that statistical features\\nthat deﬁned poverty more included F1 (variance of all pixels within the county boundary),\\nF8 (total value of all pixels within the county boundary), F6 (standard deviation of all', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",

This result\\nrepresents that the different aspects of nighttime light features reveal both the development\\nand the relative poverty in each region.\\nIt should be noted that F15 (Local autocorrelation Moran’s I of the counties) made\\na particularly important contribution to the classiﬁcation; this variable was the ﬁrst or\\nsecond most important feature for some of the approaches used in this paper and indicated\\nthe importance of spatial features in the poverty identiﬁcation task. Moreover, the impor-\\ntance of this spatial feature illustrates that its contribution to the classiﬁcation result is\\nalmost irreplaceable.\\nFinally, Pearson’s correlation analysis was conducted to analyze effects of the impor-\\ntance of each feature on the classiﬁcation’s results. According to authors, at least nine\\nfeatures should be used in models to ensure the overall accuracy.\\n4.9. Estimation of Poverty Using Random Forest Regression with Multi-Source Data: A Case\\nStudy in Bangladesh (MSDRFR)\\nThe aim of the paper is to construct a random forest regression (RFR) model for poverty\\nestimation at 10 km resolution from different datasets [ 65]. The analysis was conducted in\\nBangladesh, and the created model was also applied in Nepal. As a poverty measurement,\\nthe household wealth index (WI) was applied.\\nData for WI construction was derived from the DHS dataset for Bangladesh, which\\nconsisted of 598 household clusters. Each cluster on average contained 28.8 households,\\nwhilst the median number of households inside clusters constituted 29. NTL data for 2015\\nwas obtained from The VIIRS Cloud Mask–Outlier Removed (vcm–orm) annual composite\\nNPP-VIIRS DNB dataset. To extract the landscape’s texture and structure features, Google\\nsatellite images for the period of 2015–2017 were used. To compute the region’s accessibility,\\ndata on primary and secondary roads were excavated from the OSM dataset. Land cover\\nfeatures were extracted for 2015 from land cover maps at a 300 m resolution. The Gaussian\\nmixture model, CNN model named VGG-F [ 66], and principal component analysis were\\nconducted for features extraction. In total, 36 variables representing four dimensions of\\npoverty estimation were extracted: socioeconomic, accessibility, land cover, and structure\\nand texture. After extraction, these features were used as independent variables, whereas\\nWI served as a dependent variable.\\nIn the analysis, RFR was applied. Before implementing RFR, standardization proce-\\ndures were conducted, followed by the method of backward elimination [ 67]. In model\\ncreation, a ten-fold cross validation approach was used. The performance of the model was\\nassessed using R2between the actual and estimated WI, whereas the explanatory power of\\nfeatures was measured by the Gini importance metric.\\nAccording to results of feature selection, 14 variables out of 36 were selected. It should\\nbe noted that the highest weight among variables were obtained by variables representing\\naccessibility (42.2%). The mean NTL was the second variable by importance level (32.6%).\\nUsing the 14 selected variables, an RFR model was created. R2of the proposed\\nmodel comprised 70%. In order to check the validity of the model, the same analysis was\\nconducted for Nepal with Nepal data. In case of Nepal, R2constituted 0.61%.\\nNext, a 10*10 poverty map based on WI for Bangladesh was created using RFR,\\nwhich was compared with the Head Count Rate (HCR) map derived from 2015 survey\\ndata [ 68]. The Jenks natural breaks method [ 69] was applied to classify both maps into ﬁve\\ngrades. The patterns of these maps were almost similar. Moreover, Pearson’s correlation\\ncoefﬁcient was calculated between WI and log-transformed HCR. It admitted the existence\\nof a negative relationship between these indexes (0.6).\\nOne of the limitations of the model was that it tended to overestimate low WI val-\\nues and underestimate high WI values because the output of RF was the average result\\nof all trees. Another limitation was the existence of a multicollinearity issue between\\nindependent variables.', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

Ensemble Learning for Multidimensional Poverty Classiﬁcation (ELMPC)\\nThe aim of the paper is to conduct poverty classiﬁcation by applying the random forest\\n(RF) method on a Malaysian dataset, eKasih, for 2017 [ 70]. For poverty measurements, the\\nMultidimensional Poverty Index created by the Malaysian Government was applied. This\\nindex contained four dimensions (education, health, living standards, and income) and\\neleven indicators.\\nOverall, 196,650 observations and 24 variables were used in the analysis. These\\nvariables express different dimensions, including household information (two variables),\\nincome (two variables), health information (three variables), household location (nine\\nvariables), and household demographic (eight variables). Yet, based on the literature\\nreview, only 15 variables were selected out of 24. Before applying machine learning\\nmethods, data management was conducted by the Cross Industry Standard Process for\\nData Mining (CRISP-DM) Methodology applications. This methodology has six stages:\\nBusiness Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Model Development,\\nModel Evaluation, and Deployment [71].\\nTwo machine learning methods, RF and decision tree (J48), were applied to ﬁnd the\\nmost accurate method. In RF, the authors grew 100 trees. For training purposes, Poverty\\nStatus variables were selected as a class label. It was revealed that more trees led to error\\nrate reductions. In J48, eight rules were used that served to classify poor and hardcore poor\\npeople. In order to assess model accuracy, a confusion matrix [ 72] was created. Moreover,\\nan indicator such as Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) was applied to measure the\\nsensitivity of the prediction [ 73]. The accuracy level of RF comprised 99 %, whereas the\\naccuracy level of J48 was 98%. In ROC, the area under the curve (AUC) value is taken into\\nconsideration, where the higher AUC means a better model. The AUC value of RF and J48\\nconstituted 0.9999 and 0.9975, respectively.\\nIn order to ﬁnd the most impactful variables among 15 variables, the Mean Decrease\\nGini (MDG) indicator in RF and the Information Gain indicator in J48 were applied. RF\\npicked out ﬁve variables as important: per capita income, states, ethnic, strata, and religion.\\nFor J48, only three variables were enough: per capita income, strata, and state.\\nThe results of RF variable ranking were compared with the varImp function in R\\nlanguage for the linear model. In ranking, the median for mean rank was calculated (0.065),\\nwhich served as a line for variables being considered as important. The higher the mean\\nrank of the variable, the higher its importance level in poverty identiﬁcation. In total, seven\\nvariables were selected as the most important variables in poverty classiﬁcation: per capita\\nincome, state, ethnic, strata, religion, occupation, and education.\\nFinally, RF and J48 models were created using the above-mentioned seven variables.\\nThe results represented showed that the accuracy level of models remained unchanged in\\ncomparison with previous models, yet processing times improved (from 31.64 s to 14.97 s\\nin RF and from 3.34 s to 1.39 s in J48).\\n4.11. A Social Engineering Model for Poverty Alleviation (SEMP A)\\nThe aim of the paper is to determine a poverty line based on agent-based stochas-\\ntic model of market exchange which includes labor, commodity, and asset market out-\\ncomes [ 74]. In order to calculate the poverty line, machine learning tools were applied.\\nAs a poverty measurement, the consumption of three types of products was chosen: cereals,\\nother food, and non-food.\\nAccording to authors, modern approaches to poverty have two main weaknesses.\\nThe ﬁrst one is that consumption deprivation (CD) [ 75] or poverty is not linked with\\nthe overall economic system that causes this phenomenon.

In order\\nto obtain the multivariate version of Engel plot’s [ 77], these three types of expenses were\\ncombined into a single (non-dimensional) function using independent multivariate mod-\\nels—Neuroscale [ 78], Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) [ 79], Isomap [ 80], Curvilinear Com-\\nponent Analysis (CCA) [ 81], and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [ 82]. Authors also\\ntried to ﬁnd weights from a dimension reduction algorithm, whereas measurement weights\\nare arbitrary in the traditional multidimensional poverty index (MPI). It was suggested that\\nscalar weights in reality are the market prices. According to the PCA method, the weights\\nfor cereal, other-food, and non-food dimensions comprised 0.1694, 0.4336, and 0.8851,\\nrespectively. Thus, it served as a basis for the agent-based model (ABM) to represent the\\nmechanism of competitive markets by establishing the equilibrium of prices and quantities,\\nafter which the Langevin and Fokker–Planck model was created [75,83–85].\\nResults indicate that even when using dimension reduction tools, information can be\\npreserved. The highest level of preservation was with Neuroscale and Isomap, and lower\\npreservation was observed when used with others. Next, in order to identify the level of\\nthe relative importance of dimensions, NeuroScale mapping was applied. Interestingly,\\nas weights were not constant, they varied with income. Thus, when the expenditure level\\nwas low, the weight of other-food was the highest, whereas with an increase in expenditure\\nlevels, the weight of non-food items also started increasing. In order to prove the model,\\nit was trained on the Indian dataset for 30 years (1959–1991) and also tried on the USA\\ndataset. The outcome of algorithms was assessed using an indicator of standard deviation\\nfrom real data.\\nResults from applying the model from both countries showed that the total poverty\\nindex estimated from multivariate dimensions had lower values in comparison with the\\npoverty index derived from only cereal consumption. According to the authors, poverty\\nmeasurements should have multivariate constructions, which means that all modes of\\nincome and expenditure need to be considered for proper weighting. Furthermore, ma-\\nchine learning performs better in economic prediction when it is combined with statistical\\nmechanics-based models. This is the reason of the under performance of machine learning,\\nas only machine learning without statistical integration was used for poverty modelling in\\nmany studies.\\n4.12. Measuring Urban Poverty Using Multi-Source Data and a Random Forest Algorithm:\\nA Case Study in Guangzhou (MUPMDRF)\\nThe aim of the paper is to develop a new approach in urban poverty measurement\\nusing multi-source big data [ 86]. This new measurement is called the Multi-source Data\\nPoverty Index (MDPI), and it was created by applying RF. The idea of creating this index is\\nthat the built environment is also important in reﬂecting poverty along with census data.\\nDifferent types of data were applied for creating RF model: points of interest (POI) [ 87],\\nnighttime light image [ 88], Landsat 8 image [ 89], housing rent data [ 90], and census data.\\nThis model was created for Guangzhou, China.\\nThe analysis part had two stages. Initially, indicators of material, economic, and living\\nconditions were generated from different datasets. These indicators were next categorized\\ninto ﬁve groups: facility and service provision, land-cover composition (vegetation, build-\\ning, and water body), building texture, activity intensity, and housing cost. The RF model\\nwas created using generated indicators such as input data, which was trained using the\\nGeneral Deprivation Index GDI [91].\\nAfter creating MDPI for Guangzhou, the spatial distribution of each indicator was\\nanalyzed. For this purpose, maps were created by applying the Jenks Natural Breaks\\nClassiﬁcation Method [ 92]. Next, the relationship between each indicator and the GDI was\\nassessed using Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient. It was revealed that all indicators had a', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

Moreover, the correlation was conducted\\nbetween GDI and MDPI, and it comprised 0.954 with a p-value of 0.000.\\nIn RF, ten-fold cross-validation was applied to estimate MDPI for 1735 communities.\\nThe model was assessed by applying the coefﬁcient of Spearman’s rank correlation as\\nwell as the median relative error between the GDI and MDPI. The correlation between\\nGDI and MDPI comprised 0.954 with a p-value of 0.000, whereas the median relative error\\nconstituted 18.3%. In addition, to assess the consistency level of GDI and MDPI, Z-scoring\\nwas applied [ 93]. According to the Z-score result, there is a linear relationship between\\nGDI and MDPI with the consistent judgment rate of 89.9%.\\nIn order to identify the spatial autocorrelation’s degree of MDPI, the global Moran’s I\\nvalue was generated [ 94,95], which comprised 0.518 with a p-value of 0.01. This result rep-\\nresented the existence of a signiﬁcant level of spatial autocorrelation of MDPI. Furthermore,\\nto analyze in depth the spatial autocorrelation of the intra-regional level, Local Indicators\\nof Spatial Association (LISA) were performed.\\nResults of the model revealed that the classiﬁcation of communities possessing similar\\ncharacteristics can be classiﬁed into a high level with MDPI. The difference between GDI\\nand MDPI is that GDI performed better in the inner-city area, which had a long urbanization\\nperiod, whereas MDPI was more effective with the outer suburban area, which had been\\nexperiencing urbanization changes.\\n4.13. Estimating City-Level Poverty Rate Based on e-Commerce Data with Machine\\nLearning (ECDML)\\nThis paper represents an interesting approach in poverty measurement [ 22]. E-commerce\\ndata were used to estimate poverty rates at the city-level. For this purpose, two machine learn-\\ning methods were applied: deep neural network (DNN) [ 96] and support vector regression\\n(SVR) [ 97]. The estimated poverty rate was compared with the poverty rate calculated by\\nBPS—Statistics Indonesia [98].\\nThe e-commerce data were taken from the olx (https://www.olx.com/ (accessed on\\n16 February 2022)) platform of advertisements for goods in 2016. In the paper, in total,\\n18,881,913 advertisements were used, which were posted in 118 cities/districts of Java\\nIsland (Indonesia). Eight types of goods were analyzed in the model: cars, motorbikes,\\nhouses for sale, houses for rent, apartments for sale, apartments for rent, land for sale,\\nand land for rent. For each good, information about sale prices, number of sold goods,\\nnumber of viewers, and number of buyers was collected per city, and their sum, average,\\nand standard deviation were calculated individually. Overall, in the analysis, 96 features\\nwere extracted from the e-commerce platform and normalized between 0 and 1.\\nThe feature selection process was conducted by applying fast correlation-based ﬁlter\\n(FCBF) [ 99]. The result of FCBF represented that the model could be created using only\\n29 features and not all 96 features. For robustness checking, for each machine learning\\nalgorithm, two feature sets were used with 96 features and with 29 features; thus, in total,\\nfour models were created. According to FCBF, out of eight goods, the largest number\\nof selected features (ﬁve each) had motorbikes and cars, which implied that they were\\nimportant goods in poverty estimations for Java Island.\\nAfter conducting all these pre-processing tasks, four machine learning models were\\ncreated: SVR (with 96 features), FCBF-SVR (with 29 features), DNN (with 96 features),\\nand FCBF-DNN (with 29 features). In creating SVR models, a radial basis function was\\napplied for dealing with non-linear data. In DNN models, two hidden layers were used,\\nas with one or three layers, the output of the prediction was insigniﬁcant. In the paper, the\\nalgorithm of DNN training was provided. The performance of the model was assessed\\nusing four indicators: root mean squared error (RMSE), R-squared ( R2), accuracy factor\\n(Af), and bias factor (Bf) [100].\\nWhen comparing SVR and FCBF-SVR models, SVR had better performances with a\\nlower RMSE (3.860 vs. 4.152), higher R2(0.430 vs. 0.361), and lower Af (1.152 vs. 1.169).\\nThe prediction was underestimated only in SVR (Bf = 0.967) in comparison with FCBF-SVR.', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

Yet, after creating\\nthe FCBF-DNN model, the prediction performance improved with a lower RMSE (3.752),\\nand this model was better than the SVR model. Thus, the FCBF-DNN model was applied\\nfor poverty prediction in Java island.\\nOverall, it was illustrated that e-commerce data can serve as a good complement to\\nofﬁcial poverty prediction procedure.\\n4.14. Poverty Mapping in the Dian-Gui Qian Contiguous Extremely Poor Area of Southwest\\nChina Based on Multi-Source Geospatial Data (PMMSGD)\\nThe aim of the paper is to create a map of the integrated poverty index (IPI) for the Dian-\\nGui-Qian area (China) using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms [ 101].\\nTraditional multiple linear regression (MLR) and seven machine learning methods were\\napplied to choose the best IPI predictive model, which was used for poverty mapping\\npurposes. As a poverty measurement, IPI was applied. IPI was created by integrating\\n13 social and economic variables that represent four dimensions (economic development,\\nhealth, living conditions, and education) of poverty.\\nSocial and economic variables were taken from ofﬁcial state publications, whereas\\ndifferent datasets were used to analyze spatial features: NPP/VIIRS NTL data, Finer Reso-\\nlution Observation and Monitoring Global land cover (FROM-GLC) data, open street map\\n(OSM) data, SRTM digital elevation model (DEM) data, natural disaster data, and accessi-\\nbility to cities [ 102]. Overall, eight spatial data were extracted from the mentioned above\\ndatasets. Thus, the average nighttime light (NTL) was taken from NPP/VIIRS dataset,\\nthe altitude (H) and the ﬂat area coverage (FAC) were derived from the SRTM/DEM data,\\ntrafﬁc accessibility (TA) was provided by the city accessibility data, road density (RD) was\\ncomputed from the OSM data, the impervious surface coverage (ISC) and cropland cover-\\nage (CC) were extracted from FROM-GLC data, and a composite risk index (RI) including\\nmultiple hazards was derived from the Global Risk Data Platform to collect natural disaster\\ndata. This index ranged from 1 (low) to 5 (extreme).\\nIn the analysis process, for veriﬁcation purposes of the performance of the model,\\nten-fold cross-validation was applied in which the entire dataset was randomly divided\\ninto ten parts, nine of which were used for training and one was used for testing process.\\nThis process was repeated 10 times. In the paper, MLR was applied together with the\\nfollowing seven machine learning models: bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN),\\ngeneralized additive model (GAM), support vector machine (SVM), MARS, random forest\\n(RF), XGBoost, and Cubist. In evaluating model performance, the mean absolute error\\n(MAE) and coefﬁcient of determination ( R2) were used. The model with the best accuracy\\nwas applied to estimate ﬁnal IPI model.\\nResults illustrate that the best model was XGBoost with the MAE and R2equal-\\ning 0.0479 and 0.61, respectively, followed by GAM (MAE = 0.0498; R2= 0.59) and RF\\n(MAE = 0.0527; R2= 0.57) models. The performance of MLR model had the lowest accuracy\\nlevel (MAE—0.0767 and R2—0.23). Thus, for the ﬁnal model, XGBoost was applied.\\nMoreover, feature selection was conducted to overcome the overﬁtting problem.\\nFive variables were selected (NL, TA, RI, RD, and FAC) to conduct the XGBoost model.\\nAmong these variables, NTL had the highest importance (38.51%) rate. When XGBoost\\nwas created with these ﬁve variables, its performance improved (MAE = 0.0454, R2= 0.68).\\nAfter creating the ﬁnal XGBoost model with ﬁve variables, the predicted IPI was compared\\nwith actual IPI values. According to the results, the predicted IPI values were almost similar\\nto the actual ones. Only in wealthy areas was the IPI (IPI > 0.5) slightly underestimated.\\nNext, a poverty map was created and compared with the actual IPI map. It was revealed\\nthat in most areas, the error comprised approximately 15%, and only in few areas were\\nerrors higher than 30%. This means that the IPI map created on remote data can effectively\\npredict the poverty distribution.', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

Combining Night Time Lights in Prediction of Poverty Incidence at the County Level (CNTLPP)\\nThe aim of the paper is to show that machine learning can be applied in identifying\\nand predicting poverty at the county level [ 103]. In measuring poverty levels, a poverty in-\\ncidence indicator was applied [ 104]. The Yunnan–Guangxi–Guizhou Rocky desertiﬁcation\\n(YGGRD) area (China) was taken as a focus area of the research study. In the paper, seven\\nclassiﬁcation learning models (Decision Trees, Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression\\nClassiﬁers, Naive Bayes Classiﬁers, SVM, Nearest Neighbour Classiﬁers, and Ensemble\\nClassiﬁers) were applied to identify whether the county is poor, and ﬁve regression learning\\nmethods (Linear Regression Models, Regression Trees, SVM, Gaussian Process Regression\\nModels, and Ensembles of Tress) were used to predict poverty incidence.\\nNighttime data were extracted from DMSP/OLS (1992–2012 years) and NPP/VIIRS\\n(2013–2018 years) datasets. To correct the difference between these datasets, the modiﬁed\\ninvariant region (MIR) method was applied [ 105]. Poverty incidence data were taken from\\nofﬁcial statistical sources. The poverty incidence for the period 1992–2018 was predicted\\nin the study for the focus area by using speciﬁc NTL and poverty incidence variables\\nof 88 counties in the Guizhou Province for 2012 and 2013 years as the training data set.\\nThe following ﬁve variables of remote-sensing data were used for analysis: the total\\nvalue of the pixel digital number (DN) (Sum) corresponding to the NTL data, the average\\nvalue of pixel DN (Mean), the range of pixel DN (Range), the variability of pixels in the\\ncounty (variety) areas, and the standard deviation of pixel DN (Std) [ 18,106,107]. In the\\nanalysis, these features served as independent variables, and poverty incidence was a\\ndependent variable.\\nClassiﬁcation and regression models were assessed using different indicators. A re-\\nceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and a confusion matrix (CM) were applied to\\nevaluate classiﬁcation models, whereas regression models were assessed using the root\\nmean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the R2value of the predicted\\nand actual values [18,108].\\nAmong classiﬁcation models, SVM had the highest accuracy level (76.5%), yet it was\\nnot so effective among regression models. Among regression models, according to all three\\nparameters, The Regression Tree algorithm outperformed all models with an RMSE equal to\\n5.0143, MAE equal to 4.0415, and R2equal to 0.60 (which is almost twice as higher as in the\\nother models). Thus, SVM was chosen to conduct the classiﬁcation regression for 1992–2018,\\nand the decision tree was selected for poverty incidence prediction for 1992–2018.\\nAs the next step, to identify whether the created model can identify poverty-stricken\\nareas, SVM was applied for the 2012 year, and its result was compared with actual ofﬁcial\\ndata. Thus, results indicated that the created model had the 82.35% of the correct rate for\\npoverty-stricken counties. It was revealed that the model was inclined to identify non-\\npoverty-stricken areas as poverty stricken areas. To create a model for poverty prediction\\nfor the 1992–2018 period, the regression tree model was applied. According to its result,\\npoverty reduction in the region could be divided into three stages, when the last stage\\nshowed a signiﬁcant reduction in poverty. Furthermore, to illustrate the spatial distribution\\nof poverty incidence, spatial mapping and hot-spot analysis were conducted in the study\\nfor three years (1992, 2005, and 2018).\\nIt can be concluded that different machine learning perform differently according to the\\npurpose of their application, either with respect to classiﬁcation or prediction. Results of the\\nstudy indicate that NTL data can represent the poverty incidence effectively, and machine\\nlearning is a powerful tool for poverty analysis in the county level.', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

A Novel DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm via Edge Computing-Based Deep Neural Network\\nModel for Targeted Poverty Alleviation Big Data (DBSCANECDNN)\\nThe aim of the paper is a development of a new model called the DBSCAN Clustering\\nAlgorithm via Edge Computing-Based Deep Neural Network for poor households identi-\\nﬁcation. This method can conduct identiﬁcation via determining the poverty features of\\npoor households [109].\\nThe DBSCAN algorithm belongs to the family of clustering algorithms that are\\nbased on density. In clustering, the Eps neighborhood of each data object is calculated.\\nThe strength of this algorithm is its capacity for the automatic determination of class\\nclusters’ number, ﬁnding the shape of class clusters, and its insensitivity to noise data.\\nThe proposed model was compared with three other models: CDBSCAN [ 110], FSDB-\\nSCAN [ 111], and NARDBSCAN [ 112]. To assess the performance of all models, precision\\n(PRE), F-measure, and normalized mutual information (NMI) indexes were applied, where\\nthe value of these indexes was between 0 and 1. The closer the index to 1, the better\\nthe performance.\\nIn the paper, four experiments were conducted. The ﬁrst three experiments were\\nconducted using datasets of the machine learning repository [ 113] and by applying four\\nalgorithms. Results indicated that the DBSCAN algorithm outperformed all other methods\\nby all parameters. In addition, it also had the highest accuracy rate (99.36%) as well as the\\nhighest speed in analysis (55.5 ms).\\nThe fourth experiment was conducted using real poverty alleviation data, which\\noriginated from a prefecture-level city, including 11,423,500 from rural population, 196,700\\nfrom rural households, and 68,000 from poverty-stricken households. The original data\\nincluded the data of an archived card, the data of an agricultural cloud project, the data\\nof visits, and the data of education, health, and sanitation departments. By applying the\\nclustering algorithm, feature classiﬁcation was conducted, which identiﬁed eight clusters,\\nwhere each cluster corresponded to a feature category.\\nAccording to results, the accuracy level was the highest in the proposed DBSCAN\\nmodel (96.5%). Moreover, in the proposed method, the analysis process constituted only\\n1358 s, whereas in other models, the analysis time was calculated during several days from\\n2.5 days (NARDBSCAN) to 7 days (CDBSCAN).\\nIt can be concluded that the DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm via Edge Computing-\\nBased Deep Neural Network can be a useful tool in poverty identiﬁcation with higher\\naccuracy and quicker calculations.\\n4.17.

Furthermore, the poverty\\nmapping using the local indicator of spatial association (LISA) was conducted to identify\\ncommittees of concentrated poverty and to see if the predicted poverty incidence from\\nremote sensing using NN can recognize the same committees as the survey-based poverty\\nincidence. It was revealed that the ﬁtness of the model was good in the given areas without\\ndeviations toward low or high values.\\nWhen identifying important variables, models showed different important scores\\nfor variables. Yet, there were variables that were relatively important in urban poverty\\nidentiﬁcation, namely F18 (Histogram skewness), F17 (Histogram kurtosis), F7 (GLCM\\nentropy), F6 (GLCM uniformity), F9 (GLCM inverse difference moment), and F10 (GLCM\\ncovariance). These variables illustrate the importance of GLCM and HoG for describing\\nthe characteristics of built-up areas with different poverty levels.\\nNext, machine learning algorithms were applied by using different combinations of\\nvariables to identify the most signiﬁcant variables. Different results obtained different\\ncombinations of variables and models. According to their results, models with ﬁve variables\\n(F18, F17, F7, F6, and F9) were more accurate, with an R2ranging from 0.2903 to 0.5189.\\nIt can be concluded that machine learning is effective in feature extraction from high-\\nresolution satellite imagery and also useful in poverty identiﬁcation and feature selection.\\nIt was revealed that four applied machine learning models showed different levels of\\naccuracy with various combinations of features.\\n4.18. Multivariate Random Forest Prediction of Poverty and Malnutrition Prevalence (MRFPPMP)\\nThe paper aims achieving two goals: (1) contemporaneous mapping poverty and\\nmalnutrition indicators and (2) nowcasting near future poverty levels based on current\\nremote-sensing data and historical observations [ 121]. In order to reach these goals, machine\\nlearning methods were applied using remote-sensing data.\\nData of eleven countries, namely Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras,\\nKenya, Mali, Nepal, Nigeria, Senegal, and Uganda, which are USAID Feed the Future\\npriority countries, were used in the analysis. Indicators of poverty and malnutrition were\\nused from the DHS or Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (ARENA) [ 122]\\naggregated DHS data or directly from the DHS [ 123]. Poverty and malnutrition estima-\\ntion aggregates on the level of clusters or enumeration areas (EAs) were extracted from\\nDHS and ARENA datasets. Asset poverty, healthy weight, child wasting, child stunting,\\nand underweight women were used as dependent variables. As independent variables, six\\nsets of covariates were used: physical geography covariates (travel time to the nearest city\\nwith a population of 500,000 or more persons [ 102], percent tree cover data [ 124], pasture\\ncoverage data [ 125], altitude measured as the pixel elevation in meters above/below sea\\nlevel, slope, calculated by the IFPRI ARENA team as the degree gradient of steepness), food\\nprice data (food types, number of geographic markets, and whether the data reﬂect retail\\nor wholesale prices) [ 126], solar-induced chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (SIF) data [ 127], land\\nsurface temperature (LST) data [ 128], precipitation data [ 129], and conﬂict data (number of\\nviolent events and number of resulting casualties) [130].\\nIn the analysis, independent RF (IRF) and multivariate RF (MRF) [ 131–133] were\\napplied for poverty prediction and malnutrition prevalence. The difference between both\\nmethods is that the former predicts given indicators separately, whereas the latter exercises\\njoint estimation for all outcomes. The forest’s size comprised 2000 trees, and cross-validation\\nwas chosen as ﬁve-fold for training data.\\nIn the paper, two types of analysis were performed. The ﬁrst one was sequential\\nnowcasting (making forecasting for near future by using historical data and present inputs).\\nThe second was contemporaneous prediction (when data for one area are observed, and', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

The performance evaluation\\nof the created models was conducted using out-of-sample R2and root mean squared\\nerror normalized (NRMSE) indicators. Furthermore, predictive performance was assessed\\nin three aggregation levels. Initially, fully aggregate results were assessed, which were\\ncomputed by pooling all predictions across all surveys. Next, predictive performances\\nat the individual country level was assessed, wherein predictions were pooled across all\\nsurveys within each country. Eventually, the performance level of each individual survey\\nwas assessed.\\nResults indicate that the nowcasting of asset poverty ( R2= 0.21 (both IRF and MRF),\\nNRMSE = 0.26 (IRF) and 0.27 (MRF)) and underweight women prevalence ( R2= 0.29 (IRF)\\nand 0.31 (MRF), and NRMSE = 0.17 (IRF) and 0.12 (MRF)) was more precise than child\\nstunting ( R2= 0.07 (IRF) and 0.08 (MRF), and NRMSE = 0.21 (both IRF and MRF)), child\\nwasting ( R2=−0.01 (IRF) and 0.10 (MRF), and NRMSE = 0.15 (IRF) and 0.12 (MRF)),\\nand healthy-weight children ( R2=−0.21 (IRF) and −0.04 (MRF), and NRMSE = 0.16 (IRF)\\nand 0.15 (MRF)) variables. Furthermore, according to both R2and NRMSE indicators, MRF\\nperformed better than IRF in three out of five dependent variables. It was revealed that there\\nwas a positive relationship between predictive performance and survey size; thus, when\\nnowcasting was conducted at granular scales, the performance of the models measured\\nbyR2dropped significantly. Moreover, the nowcast map for 2013 year was created for\\neach country.\\nWhen conducting contemporaneous prediction, the performance of all models were\\nbetter in comparison with nowcasting models. Yet, when comparing performance of\\nIRF and MRF models according to both performance indicators, both of them showed\\ncontradictory results. Thus, according to R2, the best models were IRF (but with slight\\ndifferences); however, NRMSE indicated MRF as the better model. Regarding dependent\\nvariables, as in nowcasting, the best predictive capacity had asset poverty ( R2= 0.58 (both\\nIRF and MRF), NRMSE = 0.19 (IRF) and 0.00 (MRF)) and underweight women prevalence\\n(R2= 0.48 (IRF) and 0.46 (MRF), NRMSE = 0.11 (IRF) and 0.01 (MRF)).\\nIn addition, in the study, feature importance was analyzed, which was assessed\\nby using the mean decrease in impurity (MDI) for each feature. It was revealed that\\ngeographical features (location and remoteness) had the greatest explanation power in\\nboth sequential nowcasting and contemporaneous prediction, followed by vegetation and\\nweather. Interestingly, conﬂicts and food price shocks, which are traditionally considered as\\nmain causes of poverty and malnutrition, performed with relatively low predictive powers.\\nIt can be concluded that applying a multivariate prediction of poverty and multiple\\nmalnutrition indicators can slightly improve sequential nowcasting but not contemporane-\\nous prediction. Moreover, the performance of models worsened when predictions were\\nconducted at the level of individual surveys.\\n4.19. Is Poverty Predictable with Machine Learning? A Study of DHS Data from\\nKyrgyzstan (DHSML)\\nThe aim of the paper is to estimate poverty rate in Kyrgyzstan using DHS data\\nand machine learning approaches [ 134]. In the paper, the XGBoost model was applied,\\nand its outcome was compared with generalized linear model (GLM) results. Poverty was\\nmeasured using the wealth index, which ranged from 0 to 1 [135].\\nData for the analysis were taken from DHS for 2012 for nine regions of Kyrgyzstan.\\nThe data included 8040 households and 35,805 household members. In the analysis, the\\nserved wealth index was used as the dependent variable, whereas independent variables\\nwere divided into several categories: household situation [ 136], the quality of life [ 137],\\nhealth and health behavior, and education [138].\\nFor analysis purposes, the dataset was divided into a training set (90%) and test set\\n(10%). For the training set, a ﬁve-fold cross-validation was applied. Relying on the given\\ndataset, an XGBoost model and GLM were created.

When the prediction was conducted using the household head instead of all\\nhousehold members, the performance of XGBoost remained the same but the AUC for\\nGLM slightly decreased (0.881). Moreover, several analyses for poverty prediction were\\nconducted using each category of independent variables separately. It should be noted,\\nthat, overall, models created by applying XGBoost were more accurate in terms of AUC.\\nMoreover, in the paper, feature selection was conducted, and its outcome was different\\nfor both models. Thus, according to XGBoost, many variables slightly inﬂuenced prediction\\n(ﬁrst-ten variables were selected), whereas in GLM, nine variables were highlighted as\\nhaving signiﬁcant impacts, whilst the remaining variables barely contributed anything to\\nthe prediction. In addition, authors selected ten variables (region, cluster altitude in meters,\\nhectares of agricultural land, time to get to water source, number of household members,\\nage of household members, number of children, total number of years of schooling, highest\\neducational level attained, and if the household has a separate room used as a kitchen),\\nwhich were considered as important explanatory variables according to previous research\\nstudies, constructed models with them, and compared the results with machine learning\\nfeature selection results. When XGBoost was created using the above-mentioned ten\\nmodels, the AUC of the model comprised 0.908, which was slightly lower than the model\\nconstructed with all variables.\\nWhen models were created again but using only variables that were selected as the\\noutput of feature selection, the AUC for XGBoost was 0.906, and for GLM, it was 0.882.\\nIt can be seen that the performance of the models slightly decreased when they were\\nconstructed using a smaller number of variables that were chosen as important as a result\\nof feature selection.\\nIt can be concluded that using only survey data, the precise result can be obtained\\nwith the help of machine learning. It was revealed that the higher number of variables\\nimplies a more precise prediction capacity. In the Kyrgyzstan case, it can be said that\\nhousehold information and quality-of-life variables have better prediction ability than\\neducation, health, and health behavior variables.\\n4.20. Poverty Classiﬁcation Using Machine Learning: The Case of Jordan (PCML)\\nThe aim of the paper is to propose a machine learning approach for evaluating and\\nmonitoring the poverty status of households in Jordan [ 9]. For this purpose, sixteen\\nmachine learning algorithms were applied. This is the ﬁrst research study on poverty\\nprediction in Jordan via applying machine learning methods.

Framework of poverty prediction process in Jordan [9].\\nIn the analysis, household expenditure and income survey data collected by the\\nDepartment of Statistics (DoS) for 2002, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2017 were used. The dataset\\nconsisted of 63,211 households. The number of features in the analysis comprised 47, 17\\nof which were categorical and the remaining were numerical. In addition, the dataset\\nwas unbalanced between poor (13.9%) and non-poor (86.1%) people. Before creating\\nmodels, pre-processing procedures such as one-hot encoding [ 141], normalization [ 142],\\nand standardization [143] were conducted.\\nIn the paper, sixteen machine learning algorithms were applied, namely logistic regres-\\nsion [ 144], ridge regression [ 145], stochastic gradient descent [ 146], passive aggressive [ 147],\\nk-nearest neighbors [ 148], decision tree [ 149], extra tree [ 150], SVM [ 97], naive Bayes [ 151],\\nadaBoost [ 152], bagged decision trees [ 153], RF [ 154], extra trees [ 150], gradient boosting\\nmachine [ 155], light GBM [ 156], and scalable tree boosting system [ 157]. The stratiﬁed\\nten-fold cross validation was applied to evaluate models. The F1-score [ 158] was used\\nas a measurement of the model’s performance. Results showed that both LightGBM and\\nbagged decision trees algorithms had an f1-score of around 80%, which was the highest in\\ncomparison with other models. Thus, both were applied for creating ﬁnal versions of the\\nmodels.\\nAs the next stage, four methods (random oversampling [ 159], random under-\\nsampling [ 159], SMOTE [ 160], and class weights [ 161]) were applied to solve the issue\\nof unbalanced data. In order to identify which of these methods could perform better with\\nunbalanced data, LightGBM and Bagged Decision Trees were created for each method.\\nInterestingly, no large differences in the results of machine learning algorithms between\\nunbalanced and balanced data were obserfved. With the random oversampling method,\\nLightGBM had the highest f1-score (81%), whereas for bagged decision trees, the class\\nweight (grid search) balancing method was more suitable (80%).\\nIt can be concluded that different machine learning algorithms have different perfor-\\nmances with the same data. In addition, according to results of this paper, the unbalanced\\nstatement of the dataset does not have a signiﬁcant impact on the performance of machine\\nlearning methods.\\n4.21. Village-Level Poverty Identiﬁcation Using Machine Learning, High-Resolution Images,\\nand Geospatial Data (VLPIML)\\nThe aim of the paper is to estimate poverty at the village level using multi-source\\ndatasets and an RF algorithm for Yunyang County (China) [ 20]. In order to measure\\nvillage-level poverty, the poverty incidence was calculated.', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Sustainability 2022 ,14, 14238 24 of 39\\nThe data for analysis were taken from four datasets: high-resolution imagery (HRI),\\nOpen Street Map (OSM), point-of-interest (POI), and digital surface model (DSM) data.\\nThe analysis was conducted for the 2017 year. The following data were taken from the\\nabove-mentioned sources: land use map, POI (schools, hospitals, and markets), road net,\\nDEM/Slope, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Overall, ten variables\\nwere extracted from three dimensions, which identify poverty at the village level: socioeco-\\nnomic conditions (built-up land proportion, average area of Thiessen polygons, and CV\\nof Thiessen polygons), access to facilities and services (time cost to the nearest hospital,\\nschool, and market), and agricultural production conditions (forest proportion, cropland\\nproportion, proportion of the land with slopes exceeding 25, and elevation).\\nIn the study, the framework of integrating multiple datasets to predict village-level\\npoverty is proposed. Initially, explanatory variables identifying access to services and\\nfacilities, socioeconomic conditions, and agricultural production conditions were selected.\\nNext, from geospatial data, HRI explanatory variables were generated. Data processing\\nin this step consisted of three parts: HRI interpretation using the eCongnition developer,\\ntime-cost calculation to the nearest services and facilities, and the measurement of village\\nsettlement dispersity using Thiessen polygons. Eventually, an RF model was created.\\nIn RF applications, the poverty prediction task was considered as a classiﬁcation\\nproblem when poverty incidence was divided into three classes based on quantiles (poor,\\nmedium, and wealthy). The performance of the model was evaluated using out-of-bag\\n(OOB) error estimation. In the created RF model, OOB comprised 46%, which implied that\\nthe accuracy level of the model constituted 54%. In particular, the OOB for poor classes had\\nthe highest accuracy (72%), whereas for medium and wealthy classes, this ﬁgure comprised\\n49% and 42%, respectively.\\nIn the paper, feature selection was also conducted. For this purpose, two measurements\\nof variable importance were applied, namely mean decrease Gini (MDG) and mean decrease\\naccuracy (MDA). According to both indicators, the built-up land proportion had the most\\nsigniﬁcant impact on poverty prediction, followed by access to facilities and services.\\nIt can be concluded that the proposed framework can be effective in combining\\ndifferent datasets and predicting poverty levels. RF is also a useful tool for this purpose,\\nespecially in classifying poor areas. It was revealed that the poverty level can be predicted\\nalso at the village level, and the most signiﬁcant explanatory variables for Yunyang County\\nwere built-up land proportion and time cost to the nearest hospital, school, and market.\\n4.22. Classiﬁcation of Poverty Condition Using Natural Language Processing (CPCNLP)\\nThe contribution of this paper is that a new variable—feelings of people about\\npoverty—was included in poverty analyses, which has not been performed before [ 7].\\nThe research was conducted in Medellín (Colombia), with families participating in the so-\\ncial program “Medellín Solidaria: Familias Medellín”, which is aimed at combating against\\nextreme poverty. Interviews were conducted with these families, on the basis of which\\nword embedding using NLP and machine learning algorithms were applied to classify\\npoverty condition. Colombia Sisben’s score was used to rank poor people (0–100) [ 162].\\nThe value of 23.4 points was used as a cut-off score to deﬁne the threshold between poor\\nand extremely poor people.\\nData collection was conducted with semi-structured interviews that targeted four main\\nthemes: general deﬁnition of poverty, deprivations, causes, and opportunities. Texts of\\n367 interviews of people experiencing poverty were analyzed on the basis of which the most\\nsuitable word-embedding method to classify between poor and extremely poor people was\\nsearched for. Before starting analyses, text data pre-processing operations were conducted,\\nincluding tokenization, lemmatization, dependency parsing, and parts-of-speech tagging.\\nThe vocabulary size before pre-processing was 25,013, and after pre-processing, it decreased\\nto 11,572.\\nIn the paper, classical NLP methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) [ 163],\\nTerm Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) [ 164], word2Vec [ 165], Global', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

NLP methods\\ncan be used to extract speciﬁc information about what the people think of poverty, what\\npoverty is for them, what implications does it have in their lives, etc. The main advantage\\nof such an approach is that speciﬁc feelings, typically hidden in other variables, could be\\nuncovered and grouped into abstract concepts spontaneously expressed by people via\\ntheir own language. Word embeddings do not provide representation for sentences or\\ndocuments, so different statistical functionals have to be estimated to create models at\\na sentence level. Seven statistics were computed to model all words in each document\\nto obtain a document level representation. Estimating Statistical Features at a Document-\\nLevel (SFDL) (mean value, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, skewness, kurtosis,\\nand the hundred percentiles of the distribution) from the word embeddings was proposed,\\nand they are used as inputs to the classiﬁer.\\nThe outcomes of word embedding were analyzed using several statistical descriptors\\nconcatenation as well as creating super-vectors with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).\\nBefore training machine learning models, the dataset was randomly balanced by class.\\nFrom 367 interviews, 216 were extremely poor and 151 were poor. In order to create\\na balanced corpus with 151 samples per class, 151 samples from the ﬁrst group were\\nrandomly chosen (a total of 302 documents). The classiﬁcation of the poverty condition\\nwas conducted using three machine learning classiﬁers: SVM, XGboost, and RF. Ten-fold\\ncross-validation was conducted in all experiments. Three metrics were applied to evaluate\\nmodels performance: accuracy, speciﬁcity, and sensitivity.\\nIn the paper, three experiments were conducted. Counting methods were applied in\\nthe ﬁrst experiment. TF-IDF was calculated, and the words that did not appear in 99%\\nof the documents were removed. Next, their outcome was applied by machine learning\\nclassiﬁers as input data. In the second experiment, a vector representation for each word\\nin the document was constructed by applying word-embedding methods. In the third\\nexperiment, a Gaussian Mixture Model was applied.\\nResults indicate that the best model (accuracy-55.2%) was acquired applying the\\nXGBoost algorithm based on the LSA model. Results of machine learning classiﬁers were\\ncompared with the Logistic Regression algorithm , and its accuracy was lower (51%).\\nInterestingly, among experiments, there were different levels of speciﬁcity and sensitivity.\\nThe sensitivity was 79.6% in the SVM based on the GloVe model and mean values. Yet\\nthe speciﬁcity of 70.6% was gained when applying SVM based on the BERT model. It can be\\nimplied from these two results that poor people can be detected accurately with the GloVe\\nmethod, whereas extremely poor people detection can be conducted with the BERT model.\\nIt can be concluded that there is no impact on classification performance, various feature\\nextraction methods, as well as document-level representation methods. The performance of the\\nmodern methods is almost similar to the classical methods of document-level representation.\\n5. Discussion\\nAdvances in the AI sphere and data-collection ﬁeld provided substantial opportunities\\nin improving different branches of science, including poverty prediction. Thus, this study\\nwas conducted to explore the potential of AI applications in predicting poverty. To our\\nknowledge, this is the ﬁrst review that investigates applied AI algorithms and the obtained\\nresults in detail. In this section, an overview of the conducted study is provided and the\\nobtained results are discussed.\\nIn general, it can be said that there is a tendency in approaching poverty as a mul-\\ntidimensional phenomenon (see Figure 3). If the number of investigations based on the\\nmonetary approach of poverty prevailed at the beginning of the analyzed time frame, the\\nsituation changed completely starting from 2019, and only a couple of papers per year\\nused monetary approaches in poverty measurement. One reason of this tendency might\\nbe the countries’ approach in poverty measurement. Now, more and more governments\\nhave introduced new national measurement approaches in poverty analysis, admitting', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",

Apart from\\nincome or expenditure, in order to classify poor individuals, other indicators such as ed-\\nucation and health statements are also taken into consideration. This shift in the poverty\\napproach among governments is reﬂected in the examined papers, as authors take data\\non the number of poor people from governments. Another reason is that with progress\\nin exploiting different sources of data, scholars attempt to ﬁnd the variables that explain\\npoverty, acknowledging the multidimensionality of poverty. It should be admitted that\\nthe multidimensional approach to poverty can more properly reveal the situation of poor\\npeople by analyzing what opportunities they are deprived of, yet monetary approaches\\nare useful for analyzing the dynamics of household incomes and expenditure, which can\\nprovide more comprehensive insights on the economic conditions of households. It should\\nbe mentioned that, in some papers, there was a mixed approach to poverty: when poor\\npopulations were not only identiﬁed based on income but also by taking into consideration\\nother factors such as housing, education, and health [ 20], or poverty was calculated as a\\ncomposite index that also included monetary aspects such as income or expenditure [ 101].\\nThus, these papers in our study were classiﬁed as papers applying multidimensional\\napproaches to poverty.\\nAnother interesting aspect in the analyzed papers is a trend of non-traditional dataset\\nusage in predicting poverty. All data used in the papers can be divided into two large\\ngroups: ﬁeld data and remote sensing data (see Figure 5). The big difference between\\nthem is that ﬁeld data are data collected via surveys and ofﬁcial government reports whilst\\nremote data were taken from cosmos using satellites. In accordance with the subject of\\ncollection, ﬁeld data can be divided into governmental data, data collected by governments\\nand served as ofﬁcial information, and survey data, which include data collected by\\ninternational organisations or independent researchers and cannot serve as the ofﬁcial\\nposition of a country. Remote sensing data, in its turn, also can be divided into two\\nsub-groups according to the time of collection: nighttime data and day-time data.\\nFigure 5. Used data in poverty prediction.\\nMoreover, we analyzed the usage frequency of certain data types (see Figure 6). It can\\nbe seen that more than 35% of the investigated papers relied on ofﬁcial local data in their\\nanalysis. Interestingly, the second most frequently used data types (more than 20%) are\\nhousehold surveys and nighttime data, which were used in ﬁve papers each. It should\\nbe noted that although nighttime is a relatively new data type in poverty predictions, it\\nbecame widespread quite fast. Among the top-used three data types, DHS and census data\\nare also included, which are representatives of traditional datasets, and they were used in\\nmore than 15% of papers.', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",

Used data in poverty prediction.\\nRegarding applied AI methods, it can be said that although there were only 22 papers,\\namong these 22 papers, an overall of 57 AI methods were applied. This illustrates the large\\ninterest of researchers in exploring AI algorithms for application in the poverty sphere.\\nWhile analyzing applied AI methods, it can be seen that the undisputed leader was the\\nRF method, which was applied in 55% of the 22 analyzed papers. One of the reasons of\\nthe popularity of this method might be its high-level automatization, which requires less\\nhuman involvement and user’s knowledge [ 13]. Moreover, it is less sensitive to overﬁtting\\nproblems and noise, and it also can be useful in managing the multicollinearity problem\\nand multi-source data [ 169,170]. The next widely applied algorithm was SVM, which was\\nutilized in 23% of papers. The decision tree closes the top three methods, and its application\\nmeasured four times as much. The top ten applied AI methods are illustrated in Figure 7.\\nResults of the papers illustrate that AI tools had higher predictive power in comparison\\nwith traditional statistic and econometric models. The strengths of AI tools are that they\\nhave a capacity of integrating different types of datasets, extracting features from the non-\\ntraditional datasets, and handling the multicollinearity problem. Furthermore, the majority\\nof AI tools require less human involvement and have a higher calculation speed. Moreover,\\nif using the satellite imagery, poverty can be tracked in real time without interruptions,\\nwhereas when using traditional datasets and methods, poverty was predicted based on\\nsurveys that were conducted several years ago, as conducting surveys is a costly and\\ntime-consuming process. Hence, the application of AI tools can provide an upsurge in\\nresearch on poverty predictions.\\nHowever, there are several issues that AI tools still cannot settle. For instance, AI\\nalgorithms and econometric models could not manage to overcome the problem of overes-\\ntimation and underestimation in the prediction. Another challenge was the decrease in the\\npredictive power of the model, which was created for one country but applied in another\\ncountry. This means that a universal model of poverty prediction that could be effective\\nfor all countries is still not created. Furthermore, AI methods had poor performance when\\npredicting poverty over time, so this is also a challenge that should be overcome. In addi-\\ntion, using AI in underdeveloped countries with no or poor information communication\\ntechnology (ICT) infrastructure is a big challenge. Nonetheless, it is expected that the\\nimplementation of AI in these countries is promising for transforming the public services\\nof poor countries, including the medical sphere [ 26]. In order to reach this aim, several\\npolitical implications are proposed, including the creation of a comprehensive plan for\\nAI [171] and the usage of cloud technology for data collection and analysis [ 26]. Moreover,\\nit was advised that integrating AI technologies into existing governmental systems would\\nbe more effective than creating new systems [26].', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",

Conclusions and Future Scope\\nPoverty is a big concern of different governments and international organisations.\\nGlobally, great efforts are invested in combatting this issue. As an example, the United\\nNations developed Sustainable Development Goals, where the ﬁrst Goal was determined\\nas the following: “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”. Countries all over the world\\ncommenced adopting this goal into their national development strategies, which led to the\\nincrease in interest in poverty phenomena. If a government aims at reducing poverty, ﬁrst of\\nall, poverty should be estimated precisely and its drivers should be identiﬁed. In this regard,\\ndifferent methods have been applied, including AI tools. Although the implementation\\nof AI methods into poverty prediction started from recent times, substantial progress in\\nthis ﬁeld can be observed. The AI has opened the gates of big data for poverty prediction.\\nPreviously, AI application researchers were limited only to ofﬁcial and survey data (which\\nin our paper were categorized as “ﬁeld data”); now, with the help of AI, they can utilize\\nand analyze any form of data, including remote sensing data.\\nAs AI is still relatively new application in poverty prediction, until this time, to the\\nbest of our knowledge, a review on modern AI applications in poverty prediction has\\nnot been conducted. Thus, in order to ﬁll this gap, we provided a comprehensive study\\nthat provides the big picture of the state-of-the-art methods in the ﬁeld. In this paper,\\nwe analyzed 22 papers published in the time frame between 2016 and March 2022 in\\nthe journals indexed in Web of Science and/or Scopus databases. All these papers were\\ndedicated to poverty prediction via applying AI methods.\\nIn this paper, a systematic bibliometric literature review was provided, and poverty\\nprediction models were categorized with respect to poverty measurement approaches;\\nmoreover, advantages and disadvantages of the methods were discussed. Furthermore,\\nthe classiﬁcation of datasets was also conducted.\\nWhile analyzing the progress of AI applications, it is interesting to note that at the\\nbeginning, scholars were using AI techniques with caution by comparing their results with\\neconometric models and attempting to identify whether AI tools can be utilized in the\\npoverty prediction sphere. After gaining evidence of the out-performance of AI techniques\\nover econometrics one, researchers became more conﬁdent and started applying various\\nAI methods and compared their outcomes with each other. Thus, in our paper, the number\\nof methods exceeded the number of papers more than twice. Overall, 57 AI methods were\\napplied in these papers. It should be mentioned that the most popular method was random\\nforest, which was applied in more than a half of all papers.\\nMoreover, AI tools were applied also for feature selection, when more variables\\nexplaining poverty were identiﬁed. It should be noted that, generally, models created by\\nusing variables that were chosen by AI techniques had better performances in comparison\\nwith models using variables chosen via econometric tools or no variable selection.\\nIn predicting poverty, different datasets were used. In this paper, we classiﬁed these\\ndatasets in accordance with the source of data creation: whether these data were ﬁeld data\\nor remote sensing data. With the application of AI tools, the extraction of features from\\nremote sensing data has become possible, and more and more researchers started using\\nsuch forms of non-traditional datasets for poverty prediction.\\nIn summary, the following are the major contributions of this study:\\n1. Providing systematic bibliometric literature reviews;\\n2. Categorizing poverty prediction models in accordance with poverty measurement\\napproaches;\\n3. Discussing and comparing advantages and disadvantages of models;\\n4. Discussing existing challenges and opening gates for future research ideas.\\nOne of the limitations of this work is the impossibility of performance comparisons\\nbetween all applied methods, as different evaluation techniques were applied for analyzing\\nthe performance of their models in different papers. For future investigations, creating a\\nstandard universal assessment criteria for analyzing the performance of all AI algorithms\\nwould be a useful direction. Another direction for future research is the application of', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-14-14238-v2.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",

Finally, from the\\nanalyzed papers, it is observed that the area of AI applications in poverty prediction is\\nmainly from African and Southasian countries. Thus, extending the area of research to\\nother countries, conducting similar investigations with other countries, and comparing\\nresults will be useful for understanding poverty and its drivers.\\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed equally to this work.

Using\\ncontent analysis, the result pointed to the fact that artiﬁcial intelligence has a strong inﬂuence on the\\nattainment of Sustainable Development Goals particularly on poverty reduction, improvement of the\\ncertainty and reliability of infrastructure like transport making economic growth and development\\npossible in emerging economies. The results revealed that Artiﬁcial intelligence is making poverty\\nreduction possible through improving the collection of poverty-related data through poverty maps,\\nrevolutionizing agriculture education and the ﬁnance sector through ﬁnancial inclusion. The study\\nalso discovered that AI is also assisting a lot in education, and the ﬁnancial sector allowing the\\npreviously excluded individuals to be able to participate in the mainstream economy. Therefore, it is\\nimportant that governments in emerging economies need to invest more in the use of AI and increase\\nthe research related to it so that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to innovation,\\ninfrastructure development, poverty reduction are attained.\\nKeywords: artiﬁcial intelligence; Industry 4.0; innovation; infrastructure development poverty;\\nSustainable Development Goals\\n1. Introduction\\nIndustry 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) is gaining a lot of attention\\nparticularly on its potential impact on humanity [ 1]. Schwab [ 1] argued that 4IR will\\nchange how human beings live, work and how the economies work as well as how we\\nare governed. It is also believed that the industrial revolutions began as far as the 17th\\ncentury with Britain being the major player with what came to be known as the ﬁrst\\nindustrial revolution [2,3]. The word “industrial revolution can be described as economic\\nupheaval” which necessitated the changes in the “livelihood of the people from agrarian\\nrural livelihood to city and town livelihood” [ 3]. According to Blinov [ 2] before the coming\\nin of the ﬁrst industrial revolution championed by Britain, economic activities were limited\\nand as a result, many people were poor and human livelihood was sustained by what\\npeople get from the small farms which made life for an average person to be difﬁcult [4].\\nDuring this period production was mainly for their consumption, as a result, people\\nwere using basic tools which were mainly hand tools for production and production was\\nmainly conﬁned in people’s homes [ 3,4]. The coming in of the ﬁrst industrial revolution\\nmarked the replacement of animal power to the steam engine which marked the “shift from\\nagrarian livelihood” to industrialization where “special-purpose machinery” was now used\\nSustainability 2021 ,13, 5788. https://doi.org/10.3390/su13115788 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Products\\nlike textiles, iron rail transport, coal among others became common in the ﬁrst industrial\\nrevolution. On the other hand, the second industrial revolution started with the expansion\\nof electricity steel industries and petroleum industries and other scientiﬁc achievements\\nthat led to mass production [6,7].\\nAround the 1950s, the third industrial revolution began with the inventions of comput-\\ners and digital technology allowing the manufacturing sector to be automated. However,\\nthe inventions of the third industrial revolution came fourth with disruptions in various\\nindustries which include banking, energy, and communications. Ooi et al. [7] argued that\\ndespite the disruptions, the technologies opened some doors in areas of space research\\nand biotechnology opening opportunities for many people who were affected by the dis-\\nruptions. Various scholars such as Schwab [ 6], Ooi et al. [ 7] (2018), Radziwill [ 8] 2018\\nbelieve that we are currently in the 4IR or Industry 4.0 also known as the fourth industrial\\nrevolution. The three industrial revolutions became the basis or the foundation of Industry\\n4.0 which was deﬁned by Schwab [6] as:\\n“The blurring of boundaries between the physical, digital, and biological worlds. It\\nis also viewed as the fusion of advances in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), robotics, the\\nInternet of things (IoT), 3D printing, genetic engineering, quantum computing, and\\nother technologies Industry 4.0 is the collective force behind various products that are\\nfast becoming indispensable to modern life through the application of AI and machine\\nlearning. Products like the GPS systems that suggest the fastest route to a destination,\\nthe ability of Facebook to recognize human faces as well as your face and tag a person in a\\nfriend’s photo”.\\nNations all over the world are preparing and make serious plans for the impact of this\\nrevolution on humanity, economies and even businesses and the literature of the inﬂuence\\nof Industry 4.0 on society through the l is developing, this area has not been deeply\\nresearched especially the impact of AI on poverty reduction, infrastructure development\\nand the general attainment of the SDGs [ 8–10]. All the previous industrial revolutions led\\nsociety to go: “through painful processes of adaptation, for example from rural, largely\\nagricultural societies, to urban, industrial societies, and then to post-industrial societies\\ndealing with the loss of traditional industries and sources of employment” [ 2]. At the same\\nscholars argue that the impact of the 4IR on society will result not only in the loss of jobs\\nbut a marginal shift in how public and private goods and services are delivered [3,11].\\nSmith [ 12] in a study getting value from artiﬁcial intelligence in agriculture, stated\\nthat AI is beginning to live up to its promises of delivering real value due to the availability\\nof relevant data, computational ability, and algorithms. Smith [ 12] also argued that AI\\napplications can help to improve productivity in farming by improving the detection of\\ndiseases and the precision of measurements about what is happening on the farm. Eli-\\nChukwu [ 13] in another study indicated that the usefulness of AI applications has been\\nevident in the agricultural sector. In the study, Eli-Chukwu [ 13] stated that AI plays critical\\nrole to solve some of the challenges affecting the agricultural sector especially the ability\\nof farmers to maximize yields. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the\\ninﬂuence of AI on the attainment of SDGs with a direct focus on poverty reduction, goal\\none, industry, innovation, and infrastructure development goal 9, in emerging economies.\\nThe Industry 4.0 the Fourth Industrial Revolution\\nIndustry 4.0 is unique when it is compared to other previous Industrial Revolutions [ 1].\\nAccording to Schwab [ 6], Industry 4.0 has dramatic differences from the other three indus-\\ntrial revolutions due to the scale, scope, complexity, and its transformation, which will be\\nunique to all other revolutions. Schwab [ 6] argued that the revolution will be something\\nhumankind has never experienced before because it is not just an extension of the previous\\nindustrial revolution, but it is a new distinct revolution [6,10].

Some scholars also\\nbelieve that Industry 4.0 is coming up with new economic formations in various sectors of\\nthe economy such as the sharing economy where services like transport, toys, basketballs\\nare being shared [15,18].\\nOn the other hand, some researchers believe that Industry 4.0 will result in more\\ninequality due to its threat of disrupting labour markets. It is argued that the continuous\\ngrowth in automation, robots and computers will take the jobs of workers in many indus-\\ntries with the most worrying factor being the increased danger of the disappearance of\\nlow-skill/low-pay jobs which will cause a lot of challenges for the poor which will lead to a\\nrise in social tensions [ 10,19].

The other\\naspects the technological revolution will have an impact on are issues related to material or\\nideological changes caused by the introduction of new devices or new systems which will\\nhave an impact on reshaping the culture of humankind.

Literature Review\\n2.1. A Brief History and Deﬁnition of AI\\nThe Idea behind the subject of AI began in 1955 with John McCarthy who assumed\\nthat all the aspects of learning and the notable domains of intelligence can be simulated', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

On the other hand, Haenlein and Kaplan [ 21] stated that “although\\nit is difﬁcult to pinpoint the roots of AI, however, it is possible to trace back to the 1940s,\\nspeciﬁcally 1942, when the American Science Fiction writer Isaac Asimov published his\\nshort story Run around. The plot of Run around a story about a robot developed by\\nengineers. The word “Artiﬁcial Intelligence” was then ofﬁcially coined in 1956 Marvin\\nMinsky and John McCarthy one of the computer scientists at Stanford”.\\nThe term artiﬁcial intelligence is explained as:\\n“The investigation of intelligent problem-solving behaviour and the creation of intelligent\\ncomputer systems. In other words, AI describes the work processes of machines that\\nwould require intelligence if performed by humans” [20].\\nAs outlined by Wisskirchen et al. [ 20] AI has two kinds which are weak AI and\\nstrong AI. With weak AI “the computer is merely an instrument for investigating cognitive\\nprocesses the computer simulates intelligence”. Strong AI, on the other hand, entails\\n“the processes where computers are intellectual, self-learning processes. Computers can\\nunderstand through the right software/programming and can optimize their behavior\\nbased on their former behaviour and their experience” [ 20]. Strong AI includes automatic\\nnetworking with other machines, which leads to a dramatic scaling effect [ 22]. The most\\nnotable economic disciplines of AI are deep learning, robotization, dematerialization, the\\ngig economy and autonomous driving cars among others [20].\\nBenko and Sik L ányi [ 23] insinuates that even though AI has been studied for decades\\nbut it is still one of the most elusive subjects in computer science because the subject\\nis large and nebulous. It is believed that AI ranges from machines that can think to\\nsearch algorithms used to play board games. In other words, it is insinuated that AI has\\napplications in nearly all ways humans use computers in society. AI is used in subtler ways\\nwhich include examining purchase histories as well as inﬂuencing marketing decisions [ 23].\\nAccording to Buchanan [ 22] robots have always been part of the public’s perception of\\nintelligent computers, but early robotics efforts had more to do with mechanical engineering\\nthan with intelligent control. However, through the power of AI robots are becoming\\nmore powerful vehicles for the testing idea across the world about intelligent behaviour.\\nHowever, it has been argued that AI is not just about robots. It is also about understanding\\nthe nature of intelligent thought and action using computers as experimental devices [ 22].\\n2.2. The Theoretical Deﬁnitions of Poverty\\nPoverty over the years has been deﬁned with a bias towards monetary aspects, how-\\never, with time scholars are beginning to shift the deﬁnition of poverty to multidimensional\\nissues like political participation and social exclusion showing that poverty is a multidi-\\nmensional phenomenon [ 24] (Davis and Sanchez-Martinez, 2014). This means that poverty\\nis not a direct result of one factor but a combination of factors. As a result, the United Na-\\ntions (UN) deﬁned poverty in two aspects which are absolute poverty and overall poverty.\\nAbsolute poverty is deﬁned as a condition where people are deprived of basic human\\nneeds like food, health, shelter, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, education, and\\ninformation [ 25,26]. As a result, poverty is because of many factors, not only income [ 26].\\nOverall poverty is deﬁned as a condition where people are not able to have access to\\nincome and other productive resources. Overall poverty is characterized but not limited\\n“to hunger and malnutrition, ill-health, inability to access education, a rise in morbidity\\nand mortality from illness, shortage of housing, unsafe environments, social exclusion and\\ndiscrimination” [ 24]. Overall poverty also “involves a lack of participation in decision\\nmaking in civil, social and cultural life” [27].\\nThe UN also came up with another deﬁnition of poverty, the multidimensional poverty\\nindex [ 26]. The deﬁnition by the UN in 2010 involves many issues such as education, health,\\nstandards of living and many other variables. In 2013, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation\\n(JRF) deﬁned poverty as a condition where people’s material resources are not enough to\\nsatisfy the minimum needs with social participation is included [ 26,28] (Mhlanga, 2020b,\\nMhlanga, and Ndhlovu). The World Bank stressed much on consumption and income', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Sustainability 2021 ,13, 5788 5 of 16\\nof individuals as major variables which can render a person to be poor especially if the\\nindividual fails to reach a prescribed income or consumption threshold commonly known\\nas the poverty datum line [ 26]. From the various deﬁnitions of poverty, the study will\\ninvestigate how AI can have an impact on poverty from various dimensions.\\n2.3. Poverty Statistics in The World\\nThe battle against poverty is going on the world over, although there was a decline\\nin global extreme poverty, the pace is slow. The portion of the population in the world\\nliving in extreme poverty declined to 10% in 2015, down from 16% in 2010 and 36% in\\n1990 [ 29,30] (Guterres, 2019; World Bank, 2019). The statistics show that the world is not on\\ntrack in attaining the goal of reducing the world’s population living in extreme poverty\\nby 2030 [ 30]. However, the baseline projections suggest that 6%of the world population\\nwill still be living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the target of ending poverty [ 29]\\n(Guterres, 2019; World Bank, 2019). People who live in extreme poverty continue to face\\ndeeply entrenched deprivation which is sometimes exacerbated by violent conﬂicts and\\nvulnerability to disasters. It is argued that tough social protection systems and massive\\ngovernment spending on key services can help those in poverty to come out of the poverty\\nbrackets. However, there is a need for strengthening and scaling up these services [ 29]\\n(Guterres, 2019). According to Guterres [ 29] despite having a job 8 per cent of households\\nare still living in extreme poverty in the year 2018 [ 29]. The situation is worse in Sub-\\nSaharan Africa where a portion of the poor working population is approximately 38 pecent\\nin 2018 [29].\\nThe World Bank also supported the fact that poverty is still concentrated in Sub-\\nSaharan Africa. In 2019 the World bank Indicated that despite a decline in poverty rates\\nin all the regions in the world, but the rate of progress was uneven [ 30]. The World Bank\\nestimated that approximately more than half of the extremely poor people live in Sub-\\nSaharan Africa [ 30]. In 2015, it was also estimated that the portion of poor households in\\nSub-Saharan Africa rose by 9 million, while 413 million people are surviving on less than\\nUS$ 1.90 a day. This was more than all other regions in the world combined [ 26,30]. It is\\nalso believed that if the trend continues, by 2030, nearly 9 out of 10 extreme poor will be\\nin Sub-Saharan Africa [ 31]. The other worrying aspect is that the bulk of poor people in\\nthe world reside in rural areas. Most of these people are poorly educated, employed in the\\nagricultural sector, and under 18 years of age as articulated by the World Bank [ 30,32]. The\\nWorld Bank also indicated that the work to end extreme poverty is still in progress with\\nmany challenges present due to slow growth rates in many parts of the world [ 30,31]. This\\nstudy, therefore, intends to investigate how can the use of AI help to address the problem\\nof poverty which is affecting the whole world.\\n2.4. Empirical Literature Review\\nThe subject of AI and poverty is relatively new because the empirical literature on the\\nimpact of AI on poverty is still scarce. Smith [ 12] in a study getting value from artiﬁcial\\nintelligence in agriculture reasoned that AI is beginning to live up to its promises of\\ndelivering real value due to the availability of relevant data, computation, and algorithms.\\nIn the study, Smith [ 12] discusses the value of agriculture from AI in the next decade. In\\nthe study, it was discovered that AI applications can help to improve productivity on\\nthe farm through improving the detection of diseases and the precision of measurements\\nabout what is happening on the farm. The study also indicated that in many cases robotics\\nand automated systems will remove much of the need for human decision-making and\\nimprove farm efﬁciencies and farm health. AI also helps the farmers to harness the value\\nof information distributed throughout supply chains, including farm data.\\nIn another study, Dharmaraj and Vijayanand [ 33] argued that the fact that the popula-\\ntion is increasing estimated to increase by 2 billion in 2050, means that AI is important to\\nimprove the efﬁciency of farming practices. Dharmaraj and Vijayanand [ 33] also indicated\\nthat a direct application of AI or machine intelligence across the farming sector could act to', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Sustainability 2021 ,13, 5788 6 of 16\\nbe an epitome of the shift in how farming is practiced today. The study also highlighted\\nthat farming solutions that are AI-powered, on many occasions, enable a farmer to do more\\nwith less, which enhances the quality, also ensuring that farmers will go to markets very\\nfast that enhancing quick GTM (go-to-market strategy) strategy for crops.\\nAgain Vincent et al. [ 34] argued that the world population is expected to increase\\nto 2 billion in 2050, while the arable area is expected to grow by only 5%. As a result,\\nsmart and efﬁcient farming techniques powered by AI and machine learning are necessary\\nto improve agriculture productivity. The study also highlighted that the suitability of\\nagricultural land is among several critical tools that drive agricultural development. As a\\nresult, AI performs a big role in agriculture an alternative in the collection and processing of\\ninformation through wireless sensor networks. The availability of wireless sensor networks\\nis also allowing the development of low-cost sensor devices with the Internet of Things\\n(IoT) with the power of being appropriate tools for automation and decision making in\\nagriculture. Vincent et al. [ 34] believe that integrating sensor networks with AI systems\\nLike neural networks and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) can help assess the appropriate\\nland for agricultural purposes.\\nEli-Chukwu [ 13] in another study indicated that the application of AI has been evident\\nin the agricultural sector. In the study, Eli-Chukwu [ 13] stated that AI plays critical roles to\\nsolve some of the challenges affecting the agricultural sector in their endeavor to maximize\\nyields. Some challenges affecting the agricultural sector where AI can play a critical role is\\nto ensure that there are proper soil treatment, disease, and pest infestation control, ensuring\\nthat big data requirements are solved, problems of low output can also be addressed, and\\nknowledge gap between farmers and technology can be reduced. Eli-Chukwu [ 13] stated\\nthat AI can help to solve some of these challenges in agriculture due to its ﬂexibility, high\\nperformance, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness.\\nZavadskaya [ 35] investigated the application of AI ﬁnance particularly issues to do\\nwith portfolio management, bankruptcy prediction, credit rating, exchange rate prediction\\nand trading. The main idea objective of the study was the stock market prediction, and\\nwhether Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) as proxies for AI, could offer an investor more\\naccurate forecasting result. Zavadskaya [ 35] discovered that ANN performed well in the\\nprediction of results for investors compared to many models. The study also discovered\\nthat combining AI with the concept of big data, Google Trends search as a measure of\\nmarket sentiment is valuable in the modelling of returns. Cossy-Gantner et al. [ 36] also\\nstated that the ﬁeld of AI has been developing in the last 60 years and various applications\\nof AI have been utilized in high-income countries and their use in poor countries is still\\na huge challenge. Cossy-Gantner et al. [ 36] went on to argue that even though AI still\\nhas problems in its application in low-income countries it is present huge promises in the\\ntransformation of healthcare in poor nations.\\nKliestik et al. [ 37] also empirically examined the fourth industrial revolution manufactur-\\ning systems with data collected from various companies such as Deloitte, McKinsey among\\nothers at the same time Peters et al. [ 38] carried an empirical study to evaluate and analyze\\nsustainable Industry 4.0. The study made use of data collected from various companies just\\nlike Kliestik et al. [ 37] and all the studies did find the importance of AI. Just like Kliestik\\net al. [ 37] and Peters et al. [ 38]. Yigitcanlar et al. [ 39] discovered that urban innovation through\\nAI is growing smart cities where urban locations are being enabled by the community , tech-\\nnology, and policy to influence productivity, innovation, sustainability, good governance,\\nand good planning powered by AI. Yigitcanlar et al. [ 39] also found out that research on AI\\nfrom the perspective of smart cities is still emerging and more researchers are focusing on\\nAI technologies, algorithms, and their prospective applications. Yigitcanlar et al. [ 39] also\\ndiscovered that there is limited research on the risks of the utilization of AI and the future\\ndisruptions of AI on cities has not been investigated fully .\\nHow et al. [ 40] also came up with a study to assess the no-coding human-centric\\nAI-based approach in the analysis or prediction of the intentions of the ﬁnancial products\\noffered. How et al. [ 40] found that ﬁnancial service providers must understand the na-', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

[ 40] believed that applying AI on legacy data is critical to assist ﬁnancial service\\nproviders to anticipate how prospective customers respond when they are approached with\\nproducts. The study by How et al. [ 40] found out that a key factor in poverty reduction is ﬁ-\\nnancial inclusion powered by AI, but it has been discovered that ﬁnancial service providers\\nwho do not know about computer programming to implement AI projects continue to\\nexperience challenges.\\n3. Research Methodology\\nThe study used secondary research to investigate the inﬂuence of AI on the attainment\\nof SDGs with a direct focus on poverty reduction, goal one, industry, innovation, and\\ninfrastructure development goal 9, in emerging economies. To analyze the impact of AI\\non the attainment of the SDGs objectively the study used unobtrusive research techniques.\\nElo et al. [ 41] deﬁned unobtrusive research as the methods of data collection where the re-\\nsearcher does not interfere with the subjects under investigation. This is mainly because the\\nmethods are not obtrusive [ 42]. The study made use of content analysis which is the study\\nrecorded information in texts, media, or physical items. In other words, content analysis is\\na research technique used in the determination of the availability of certain words, themes,\\nor concepts within some given qualitative data text or data. The content analysis allowed\\nthe study to quantify and analyze the presence, meanings and relationships of such certain\\nwords, themes, or concepts that acted as the basis for the arguments and conclusion of\\nthe study. Secondary sources of data like governments reports, international statistics,\\nmedia articles, peer-reviewed journal articles, books were critically reviewed to inform the\\ndiscussions in the paper. The main limitation of the current study is the fact that some of the\\nofﬁcial complex hard data and peer-reviewed journal articles and books on the inﬂuence\\nof AI on poverty, innovation, infrastructure development and sustainable development is\\nstill developing. However, the author tried to utilize the available information that was\\npublished by scholars, private organizations, and governments through various organiza-\\ntions. The advantage of content analysis is its non-invasive nature when analyzing a social\\nphenomenon [ 42]. Content analysis is used in speciﬁcally three different approaches which\\ninclude the conventional, directed, and summative. According to Elo et al. [ 41], the three\\napproaches help in the interpretation of meaning from the content of text data permitting\\nthem to conform to the naturalistic paradigm. The current study was mainly premised\\non the summative content analysis involves the counting and comparisons of keywords\\nand interpret the context in the keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the\\nunderlying context [42].\\n3.1. Discussion of the Impact of AI on Poverty, Innovation, and Infrastructure Development\\nAI technologies can play a central role in the achievement of the Sustainable Devel-\\nopment Goals (SDGs). This study is assessing the impact of AI on poverty, which is goal\\none of the Sustainable development goals, end poverty in all its manifestations and goal 9\\nIndustry, innovation, and infrastructure development.\\n3.2. The Role of AI in Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure Development\\nOne of the critical components of economic growth and development is an investment\\nin infrastructure and innovation [ 43]. It is estimated that over half of the world’s population\\nis living in cities, making infrastructure development and innovation in mass transport\\nand renewable energy very critical [ 44]. Conde and Twinn, [ 44] went on to argue that\\nthe massive growth in the population in cities also makes the growth of new industries,\\nthe growth of information and communication technologies (ICT) and AI very critical.\\nThe other stubborn fact is that more than 4 billion people do not have internet access and\\nover 90 per cent of these people are found in the developing world [ 45]. The only way to\\nbridge this digital divide is to make sure that there is massive infrastructure development,\\na massive increase in access to information and knowledge as well as fostering innovation', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

It is also believed that 2.3 billion people the\\nworld over cannot access basic sanitation due to infrastructure constraints which cut\\nbusiness productivity in many low-income African countries by approximately 40% [ 46].\\nThe United Nations also reported that approximately 2.6 billion people in developing\\nnations do not have access to constant electricity and the renewable energy sectors currently\\nemploy more than 2.3 million people which is predicted to rise to 20 million by 2030 [ 47].\\nThe other serious problem that manifests because of the lack of proper infrastructure is that\\nbarely 30 per cent of agricultural products in developing countries went through industrial\\nprocessing as compared to 98% in high-income countries [46,47]\\nAccording to Conde and Twinn, [ 44] AI is now changing the world economy and it\\nis estimated that advances in AI could add approximately 13 trillion to global economic\\noutput by 2030. In the transport sector, the global market for transport-related AI tech-\\nnologies reached $1.2 to 1.4 billion and it is estimated to grow to 3.1 and 3.5 billion by\\n2023 which is a 12 to 14.5 growth from 2017 to 2023 [ 44]. Various AI interventions can be\\napplied to various sectors to improve the infrastructure, for instance, the transport sector,\\nagriculture which can transform these sectors towards the attainment of the SDGs. The\\nWorld Bank stated that the applications of AI in the transport sector go beyond driverless\\nvehicles but can solve various problems related to safety for drivers and pedestrians. Road\\ntrafﬁc accidents are one of the health hazards especially in developing countries Conde\\nand Twinn, [ 44] (2019) reported that road trafﬁc-related deaths reached 1.35 million in 2016\\nup from 1.25 million in 2013 and most of the accidents happened in low-income nations.\\nSome of the reasons given are inadequate infrastructure, poor roads, and vehicles without\\nmodern safety equipment as well as human error.\\nOne of the reports by Conde and Twinn, [ 44] reported stated that in the European\\nUnion (EU) human error, speeding, distraction, and drunk driving contributes to more than\\n90 per cent of all the accidents on roads. In 2017 alone approximately 25,000 people lost\\ntheir lives in these accidents in the EU. Research is pointing to the fact that the application of\\nAI through autonomous vehicles can help to reduce trafﬁc accidents by approximately 90%\\nby 2050 in some developed nations. The ﬁrst attempt by Tesla at an autonomous vehicle\\nreduced accident rates by 40 per cent the moment self-driving technologies were activated.\\nIt is a fact that though autonomous vehicles will bring some beneﬁts, the deployment in\\nemerging markets will take a long time, but some researchers project that there will be\\n1 driverless car in every 4 cars in 2030.\\nThe other aspect where AI is doing a lot is the improvement of the certainty and\\nreliability of infrastructure, especially in the transport sector. The World Bank reported\\nthat one enabler of the safe and efﬁcient movement of goods and people the ability to be\\nable to forecast arrival and departure times. Companies such as Uber and Lyft are using\\nAI applications in different ways to offer the much-needed reliability pickup and drop-off\\ntimes for their routes. So, these AI applications can be applied to improve the quality of\\npublic transport solutions globally. One example is Via a company in New York city in\\nAmerica which is giving licenses to its technology to the New York City Department of\\nEducation to come up with designs of smart bus routes which will provide transparency\\non pickups and drop-offs. AI is also playing a crucial role in maintaining the environment,\\nfor instance, in the transport sector AI technology can reduce the number of inefﬁcient\\ntrips at sea and on the road through the optimization of routes to improve fuel efﬁciency\\nand reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. It was estimated that the world over 23% of\\ntotal energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. One of the eco-friendly AI application is\\nwell known as truck platooning which is a technique that can successfully connect several\\ntrucks wirelessly to a lead truck permitting them to operate much closer to each other\\nsafely, realizing fuel efﬁciency.\\nIn emerging markets, we have several case studies where AI is being used to improve\\nindustries and infrastructure. Many cities in the world are using AI to assist solve trafﬁc\\nﬂow challenges. In India, a city called Bengaluru Siemens mobility came up with a\\nmonitoring system that makes use of AI through trafﬁc cameras to detect and calculate the', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Sustainability 2021 ,13, 5788 9 of 16\\ndensity of trafﬁc on the road and then through the power of AI the trafﬁc lights will be\\naltered based on real-time road congestion. The other example is Alibaba one of China’s\\ne-commerce companies introduced the City Brain to try and improve efﬁciency and reduce\\nroad congestion through utilizing data from trafﬁc lights, closed-circuit television (CCTV)\\ncamera as well as video recognition to suggest trafﬁc ﬂow management. The other case\\nstudy is of the two Chinees companies China Post and Deppon Express that are in logistics,\\nthey are using AI driving technology from Fabu to introduce autonomous trucks on\\nChinee’s roads. These trucks were tested, and they become successful on level 4 autonomy\\nwhich implies that they can operate on selected conditions without human input.\\nDrones are also another classical example of the application of AI especially in places\\nwhere there is no infrastructure like Sub-Saharan Africa where drones are being used in\\nhealthcare. Rwanda is one of the countries where the commercial drone was launched\\nfor commercial drone delivery service. Drones are used to ﬂy medical supplies such as\\nblood. One example is An American start-up Zipline which partnered with the government\\nof Rwanda to lunch the ﬁrst commercial drone delivery service, ﬂying medical supplies\\nfaster than road transport. The other example that was given is the China start-up Sichuan\\nTengden Technology which developed a drone with the capacity to carry 20 tons of cargo\\nand it can ﬂy up to 7500 km. Apart from drones, many countries are developing smart\\nairports that are making use of intelligent navigation systems with the ability to do facial\\nrecognition and big data analysis for a paperless and more efﬁcient experience.\\n3.3. Poverty Mapping and Poverty Data Collection\\nThe World Bank estimates that 736 million people live in extreme poverty worldwide,\\nand half of them are in just ﬁve countries which are India, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic\\nof Congo, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh. The World Bank and the UN in their ﬁght against\\npoverty rely heavily on research and data to measure progress towards this goal [ 48].\\nStrusani and Houngbonon [ 43] in their study indicated that AI technologies are coming\\nup with new and efﬁcient ways of monitoring and evaluating development interventions\\nthat are meant to target the poor and those in need. One of the problems that affect\\nemerging economies is the fact that they lack the data which is critical to ﬁne-tuning the\\ndevelopment interventions [ 43] (Strusani and Houngbonon, 2019b). AI is now coming in\\nwith the capacity to make use of unstructured data such as images, texts as well as audio o\\ncome up with the information required to improve the various outcomes of development.\\nThe Decentralized AI Alliance in 2020 reported that the impossibility to collect data is\\na consequence of poverty itself. The organization went on to report that the location of\\nthe people that are in poverty or need is a fundamental variable that needs to be taken\\nseriously in the objective to end poverty in all its forms everywhere [ 49]. It is believed that\\ncountries are not collecting as much data and scaling up traditional household surveys to\\nidentify the number of poor people and the regions where these people are located. This\\nis also worsened by the fact that traditional household surveys are expensive to many\\nnations [49].\\nHowever, AI can assist to change this. A recent study by a team at Stanford University\\nis using satellite images to provide an alternative to map poverty [ 50]. The study focused\\non ﬁve Africana countries namely, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi and Rwanda social\\nscientists and computer expert came up with the idea of using high-power satellites to\\ndetect poverty through an analysis of their images. In a way to corroborate the predictions\\nfrom the study, the researchers used accurate survey data [ 50]. In a way to effectively map\\npoverty, AI can combine high-resolution satellite imagery with powerful machine learning\\nalgorithms and predict how rich or poor speciﬁc locations around the world are. AI can\\nhelp to effectively provide information like the distance from the nearest water sources,\\nthe nearest urban market or where the agricultural ﬁelds are, and many other important\\nvariables used when measuring poverty [49].\\nThe Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), which is part of Hamad Bin Khalifa\\nUniversity, is also collaborating with several organizations such as the World Bank and', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Sustainability 2021 ,13, 5788 10 of 16\\nUN to tackle poverty among other global problems using AI [ 48]. QCRI also developed the\\nAI for Digital Response (AIDR) platform, which analyses data during disasters, such as\\nthe hurricanes like Hurricane Dorian. These analyses help a lot to map the areas where\\nhelp is needed the most and the level of effort needed to respond to a disaster [ 48]. The\\nQCRI also work directly with relief organizations in the development of technologies used\\nin the analysis of big data in times of disaster in a way to analyze the conditions for the\\nallocation of resources [ 48]. With machine learning, the QCRI is producing poverty maps\\nby utilizing anonymous advertising data from Facebook [ 48]. In India, there was the use of\\nmachine learning on value-added tax data to improve the targeting of ﬁrms for audits. AI\\napplication was also used in predicting travel demands after the hurricane in India and to\\nassess where food insecurity will mostly occur to improve target interventions.\\n3.4. The Impact of AI on Agriculture in Rural Areas\\nThe deﬁnition of poverty as highlighted before is a multifaceted phenomenon in other\\nwords poverty is multidimensional. It manifests itself in lack of income, lack of education\\nand sometimes lack of social assistance and even food insecurity [ 49]. This mostly affects\\nrural areas where most of the poor people reside. According to the World Bank, agriculture\\nis the source of livelihood in areas where poverty is more prevalent [ 51]. Strusani and\\nHoungbonon [ 43] reported that AI application can address the various challenges that are\\nfaced by the people at the bottom of the income distribution especially the bottom 40%.\\nEven though most of the poor people cannot purchase AI-enabled equipment, it has been\\nargued that these people can directly beneﬁt from AI through AI service solutions through\\ntheir mobile devices. The practical example is the machine learning application, Nuru that\\nwas used in the agricultural sector in Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania. This application\\nwas used in farms in the identiﬁcation of leaf damage in photos taken by farmers that were\\nsent to authorities to assist in monitoring the presence of one of the evasive pests that have\\nbeen threatening the revenue of farms and food security across East Africa.\\nThe other importance of AI is the fact that the data generated from mobile phones can\\nbe highly correlated with the ﬁnancial status, education level as well as health status. This\\ncan allow mobile applications to deliver microlending, the establishment of personalized\\ntutoring, the diagnosis of health and medication advice. The critical use of AI applications\\nis the removal of literacy barriers among the poorest individuals through AI speech recog-\\nnition and speech to text functionalities, especially when accessing text-based applications.\\nIn most rural areas that are far from the urban areas AI through image recognition can be\\nused in the assessment of microinsurance claims of farmers. All these AI application among\\nthe farmers help to improve productivity which will allow them to improve their revenue\\nand to become food secure. The Decentralized AI Alliance in 2020 also reported that AI can\\naddress the problem of poverty through improving farming soil cultivation for growing\\ncrops and the rearing of animals as a way of providing food and other important products.\\nThrough AI applications robots can now help farmers to harvest crops and predicting the\\nbest ways for farmers to grow different crops [49].\\nSchmidt [ 50] also stated that using robotics, AI is becoming an important variable in\\nsolving world hunger. Schmidt [ 50] believes that there is progress being made by corpo-\\nrations and university programs such as Google and Stanford University’s Sustainability\\nand Artiﬁcial Intelligence Lab. These organizations are coming forth with AI programs\\nin agriculture which are doing a lot to improve farming, helping in the identiﬁcation of\\ndiseases, prediction of crop yields and location of areas prone to scarcity. One example\\nwhere AI is being applied is through FarmView programme created by researchers from\\nCarnegie Mellon University (CMU) to help farmers to grow more food using the same\\nnumber of crops. This effort is being applied to come up with rapid solutions to the critical\\nproblem of paid rise in population. It is estimated that by the year 2050, approximately\\n9.8 billion people will live on the planet, and this will increase food scarcity making this\\ntopic very critical. However, the availability of AI will help to improve farming methods\\nsensing and robotics technologies to improve plant breeding and crop management [ 50].', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Sustainability 2021 ,13, 5788 11 of 16\\nResearchers are busy collecting a lot of information using drones, robots, and stationary sen-\\nsors to increase yields of drought and heat resistant crops that can thrive in famine-stricken\\nnations [ 49,50]. Through AI technology researchers and machine learning technologies\\ndata is analyzed to determine what factors yield more sorghum [49,50].\\nAnother example of where AI is helping a lot in agriculture is through industry\\nPlantMD. PlantMD is an application created by high school students Shaza Mehdi and Nile\\nRavanell in Georgia United States of America. This application allows a farmer to detect\\nplant diseases [ 50]. This application was built using Google’s TensorFlow, an open-source\\nmachine learning library [ 50]. The PlantMD application was inﬂuenced by Nuru one of the\\napplications built by a research team at Penn State University Pennsylvania called Plant\\nVillage alongside the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture. The application (Nuru)\\nas highlighted before was created to combat disease and pest susceptibility in cassava,\\none of the crops that feed half a billion Africans daily [ 49,50]. Farmers had difﬁculties\\nin inspecting and managing every crop. As a result of the availability of AI, machine\\nlearning is now used to increase efﬁciency in the process of disease and pest control. “A\\nmachine learning model was trained using thousands of classiﬁed cassava images and\\nthe model was turned into an application where farmers can send images of their crop\\nand receive information which gives them the ability to identify diseases with options\\navailable to manage the diseases” [ 49]. In this way, AI is assisting African agriculture to be\\nsustainable which can help agriculture to feed the people. Similarly, Stanford University is\\nutilizing machine learning to understand and predict crop yields in soybeans. Moreover,\\nit is believed that machine learning can also assist in discovering places in developing\\nand underdeveloped nations with food insecurity issues through satellite technology. The\\nnext section is outlining how AI can help in the education sector. All these developments\\nare supported by various scholars who investigated the importance of AI in growth and\\ndevelopment of economies for instance, Vincent et al. [ 34] argued that the world population\\nis expected to increase to 2 billion in 2050, while the arable area is expected to grow by\\nonly 5%. As a result, smart and efﬁcient farming techniques powered by AI and machine\\nlearning are necessary to improve agriculture productivity. Eli-Chukwu [ 13] in another\\nstudy also indicated that the application of AI has been evident in the agricultural sector.\\nIn the study where AI plays critical roles in solving some of the challenges affecting the\\nagricultural sector in their endeavor to maximize yields. For instance, ensuring that there\\nare proper soil treatment, disease, and pest infestation control, ensuring that big data\\nrequirements are solved, problems of low output can also be addressed, and knowledge\\ngap between farmers and technology can be reduced.\\n3.5. The Impact of AI on Education\\nPoverty is usually associated with the inability of households to have formal educa-\\ntion. The World Bank estimates that about 39% of the world poorest do not have formal\\neducation. Aspects that hinder access to education for many households is purely the\\ncost factor and capacity of the institutions of higher learning. Many institutions have a\\nprescribed number of people they can accommodate [ 52]. AI can assist in raising the levels\\nof education for the poor children the various methods which include adapted learning\\ntechniques using computer algorithms to encourage interaction with the learner as well as\\ncoming up with an education that is tailor-made for the needs of each learner [ 49]. Using\\nAI, it is highly possible to discover the speciﬁc learning need s of each learner and be able\\nto satisfy these requirements using various methods of learning. In other unique circum-\\nstances, intelligent chat boards are used as tutors breaking the money barrier to education\\nto pupils who come from poor areas which will help to address access issues ﬁnally be able\\nto address inequality at the same time. One study by Mhlanga and Moloi [ 18] revealed that\\ntechnology related to Industry 4.0 helped a lot during the COVID-19 social distancing for\\nlearners to be able to move on with education even during the lockdown. The study also\\nfound that technology can even increase access to education especially online education\\nwhere space is not a limiting factor. One of the education projects where AI is assisting in', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Sustainability 2021 ,13, 5788 12 of 16\\neducation is through the social enterprise Eneza Education where AI is used in tutoring\\nmillions of rural students in Kenya, Ghana, and C ôte d’Ivoire. In this way, AI is helping a\\nlot in the achievement of quality education [ 49]. This also enables education to be inclusive\\nand equitable creating and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all [ 49,53]. Just\\nlike Mhlanga and Moloi [ 18], Chua and Valencia, [ 54] documented the importance of AI\\nin education during the lockdown necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Chua and\\nValencia, [ 54] found out that AI will play a signiﬁcant role in education especially during\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic even though they argued that it will be difﬁcult for AI to replace\\nhumans in administrating education.3.6. AI and Digital Financial inclusion.\\nDigital ﬁnancial inclusion is viewed as a way of reaching out to the households who\\nare not ﬁnancially active, that is those who are not able to enjoy formal ﬁnancial services\\nthat are designed to meet their needs [ 8,55]. Mhlanga, [ 8] argued that people who are\\nexcluded from the formal ﬁnancial sector are women, youth, and the poor especially those\\nstaying in rural areas. Strusani and Houngbonon [ 43] argued that the traditional ways\\nof reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity are being subjected to technological\\ndisruptions where AI is changing the cost of access to products and services, changing how\\ninformation is gathered, how products are made as well as how people interact. Strusani\\nand Houngbonon [ 43] went on to argue that the challenges associated with development are\\nincreasingly becoming intertwined with technology where the goals of ending poverty and\\nboosting shared prosperity are becoming critically dependent on harnessing the power of\\ntechnologies like AI and at the same time looking for ways to minimize the risks associated\\nwith these technologies.\\nIt has been established that in emerging markets countries are beginning to use\\nbasic AI to come up with solutions to critical challenges of development especially in the\\nprovision of ﬁnancial services to underserved and unserved population [ 43]. The massive\\nprogress in basic machine learning algorithms and the growth in the number of technology\\nusers made it possible for emerging markets to use AI solutions like credit scoring and\\ntargeted advertising. Some early examples of AI being delivered in ﬁnancial markets\\ninclude the MoMo Kash in Cote d’Ivoire, M-Kajy in Madagascar, M-Shwari in East Africa,\\nand Ant Financial in East Asia. M-Shwari made use of machine learning to come up with a\\nprediction of the probability of default of potential borrowers making it possible for small\\nloans to be delivered to 21 million Kenyans by the end of 2017.\\nBetter data processing, a massive increase in access to credit is making AI drive inno-\\nvation in ﬁnancial services through relying on non-traditional data like mobile phone call\\nrecords, mobile money transactions data, text messages and address books. Another im-\\nportant aspect of AI is that it reduces information asymmetry in contexts where borrowers\\nlack credit history like ﬁrst-time borrowers and the unbanked. In addition, AI is making\\nﬁnancial services more affordable due to the automation of credit scoring which is one\\nof the processes that was devoted to human resource in traditional ﬁnancial institutions.\\nThrough machine learning algorithms, a large amount of mobile phone data can be parsed\\nin delivering instantaneous credit scores to users in emerging economies. The scoring\\nalgorithm improves once the user is offered a loan by absorbing credit history data. Branch\\none of the ﬁntech companies is one example where this approach is being used through\\noffering microloans to ﬁrst-time borrowers and customers without banking accounts in\\ncountries like Kenya, Nigeria, India, and Mexico.\\nIn Africa, the popularity of digital ﬁnancial inclusion increased when M-Pesa become\\none of the success stories in the payment innovations that started in Kenya [ 56]. M-Pesa is\\na mobile banking service lunched in 2007 by Safaricom the largest mobile phone operator\\nin Kenya that allows users to store and transfer money through their mobile phones. In\\nAsian countries like China digital ﬁnancial inclusion is viewed as more than payment\\ninnovations which include digital investment, payments, and investment [ 56,57]. The\\nimportance of digital ﬁnance is its ability to utilize information communication technology\\n(ICT) in increasing the scale and use of ﬁnancial service by the poor and those excluded\\nfrom the formal ﬁnancial market [ 8,58]. The coming in of ICT and AI allowed ﬁnancial', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Sustainability 2021 ,13, 5788 13 of 16\\ninclusion to become digital and to allow groups of vulnerable people to be able to access\\nﬁnance [ 59]. Mhlanga, [ 8] agree with Wang and He, [ 56] that for business to be the\\nactivity to be successful when it is done with people at the bottom of the pyramid, radical\\ninnovations such as the use of AI is one of the requirements. The application of AI in\\ndigital ﬁnancial inclusion makes it different from traditional ﬁnancial inclusion because\\nwith digital ﬁnancial inclusion, there is a massive reduction in transaction costs, especially\\nin the rural areas because of lower marginal costs since with digital ﬁnancial inclusion\\nservice provider necessarily do not need to have physical outlets [ 56]. The use of T AI and\\nvarious ICT tools overcomes the major problem of traditional ﬁnancial inclusion which is\\ninformation asymmetry [8,60].\\nVarious online services and products provide a vast amount of information to cus-\\ntomers which could not be accessible without the use of digital services [ 8]. Peric, [ 61]\\nstated that the beneﬁts of digital ﬁnancial inclusion access to formal ﬁnancial services by\\nthe poor people who were ﬁnancially excluded, the other beneﬁt is that digital ﬁnancial\\ninclusion helps to preserve the disposable incomes of the households because digital ﬁnan-\\ncial services and products are usually offered at a lower cost to the customer and the service\\nprovider. The use of AI also allows customers to be able to transact in irregular small\\namounts to assist them to manage their uneven incomes [ 8,62]. The other beneﬁt of digital\\nﬁnancial services is that it helps to reduce the risks of loss, theft, and other ﬁnancial crimes\\nposed by cash-based transactions [ 8,63]. Digital ﬁnancial inclusion promotes economic\\nempowerment by allowing the accumulation of assets for women, the youth, and the rural\\npeople which increases their economic participation [8,64].\\n4. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations\\nIndustry 4.0 is gaining a lot of attention particularly on its potential impact on hu-\\nmanity and the potential it has in changing how human beings live, work and how the\\neconomies work as well as how we are governed. This study investigated the inﬂuence of\\nIndustry 4.0 particularly AI on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\\nwith a direct focus on poverty reduction, industry, innovation, and infrastructure develop-\\nment in emerging economies. The study used content analysis and the results indicated that\\nAI has a strong inﬂuence on the attainment of SDGs particularly poverty reduction in areas\\nof relevant data collection through poverty maps, its ability to revolutionize agriculture,\\neducation, as well as the ﬁnancial sector through digital ﬁnancial inclusion. The study\\nalso found out that AI is equipping researchers to use satellite images to map poverty, to\\nidentify the regions where poverty is more concentrated. These initiatives are assisting\\nin the identiﬁcation of the number of poor people and the regions where these people\\nare located making the poverty reduction initiatives more successful. Researchers are\\nalso using various robotics and AI programs like the “Google and Stanford University’s\\nSustainability and Artiﬁcial Intelligence Lab”, to come up with AI programs in agriculture\\nthat are helping to improve farming, through effective diseases detection, prediction of crop\\nyields, and location of areas prone to a scarcity. In education, AI is improving education\\nthrough various methods which include adapted learning techniques using computer\\nalgorithms to encourage interaction with the leaner among several other notable signs of\\nprogress in the sector. AI is also enabling massive infrastructure development, increase in\\naccess to information and knowledge as well as fostering innovation and entrepreneurship.\\nThe other aspect where AI is doing a lot is the improvement of the certainty and reliability\\nof infrastructures like the transport sector making economic growth and development\\npossible since one of the critical components of economic growth and development is\\nan investment in infrastructure and innovation. Therefore, the study recommends that\\nGovernments in emerging economies, development institutions and other organizations\\nthat are striving in the achievement of the SDGs do invest more in AI as well as adopting\\nand scaling up its use as it presents unlimited beneﬁts.\\nThe main limitation of the current study is the fact that some of the ofﬁcial complex\\nhard data and peer-reviewed journal articles and books on the inﬂuence of AI on poverty,', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/sustainability-13-05788.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

The \\nword \\n“\\nindustrial revolution can be described as economic upheaval\\n”\\n \\nwhich necessitated the \\nchanges in the \\n“\\nlivelihood of the people from \\nagrarian rural livelihood to city and town \\nlivelihood\\n”\\n \\n(Dunga, 2019). According to Blinov (2014) before the coming in of the first \\nindustrial revolution championed by Britain, economic activities were limited and as a result\\n,\\n \\nmany people were poor. During \\nthis period, human livelihood was sustained by what people \\nget from the small farms which made live for an average person to be difficult (Allen, 2006).\\n \\nAlso, during this period production was mainly for own consumption\\n, as a result,\\n \\npeople were \\nusing basi\\nc tools which were mainly hand tools for production and production was mainly \\nconfined in people’s homes (Allen, 2006, Dunga, 2019). The coming in of the first industrial \\nrevolution marked the replacement of animal power to the steam engine which marked th\\ne \\n“\\nshift from agrarian livelihood\\n”\\n \\nto industrialization where \\n“\\nspecial\\n-\\npurpose machinery\\n”\\n \\nwas Preprints  (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 16 September 2020                    doi:10.20944/preprints202009.0362.v1\\n©  2020 by the author(s).

The \\nfirst industrial revolution led to the rise in coal, textiles, iron, and rail road’s industries while \\nthe \\nsecond industrial revolution\\n \\ncame forth with \\nthe \\nmassive expansion of electricity, \\npetroleum, and steel i\\nndustries. Also, other and other scientific achievements led to mass \\nproduction (Ooi et al., 2018).\\n \\nAround the 1950s the \\nthird industrial revolution\\n \\nbegan with the inventions of computers and \\ndigital technology. The inventions of the second industrial revo\\nlution led the manufacturing \\nsector to be automated. \\nHowever\\n, the inventions of \\nthe third industrial revolution\\n \\ncame fourth \\nwith disruptions in various industries which include banking, energy, and communications. \\nDespite the disruptions, the technologies \\nopened some doors in areas of space research and \\nbiotechnology (Ooi et al., 2018).

       "  Document(page_content='3\\n \\n \\n1.1.\\nThe difference of the industry 4.0\\n/4IR\\n \\nto other revolutions\\n \\nIndustry 4.0 is unique when it is compared to other previous Industrial Revolutions (Schwab, \\n2015). According to Schwab (2\\n017), industry 4.0 has dramatic differences with the other three \\nindustrial revolutions. The scale, scope, and complexity and the transformation of the industry \\n4.0 will be unique to all other revolutions. It will be something \\nhumankind\\n \\nhas never \\nexperienc\\ned before (Schwab, 2017). Industry 4.0 is not \\njust\\n \\nan extension of the\\n \\nprevious \\nindustrial \\nrevolution,\\n \\nbut it is a new distinct revolution\\n \\n(Berce, 2016; Schwab, 2017). \\n \\nThe first notable difference of the industry 4.0 to other past revolutions is the produ\\nction of \\ninformation. In the industry, 4.0 people \\ncan\\n \\ncome up with new information as well as generating \\nnew knowledge in the mining of information (Berce, 2016; Schwab, 2017). This is enhanced \\nby the possibilities available for \\nmany people to be connected \\nby mobile gadgets with strong \\nprocessing power, stor\\nage capacity, and unlimited access to knowledge\\n \\n(Banwari, 2018; \\nKravchenko and Kyzymenko, 2019). In a way, the continuous data accumulation and analysis \\nis \\npermitting\\n \\nthe\\n \\nintelligence of machines to improve.\\n \\nThe other issue which makes the industry \\n4.0 to \\nbe unique from other industrial revolutions is the fact that the industry 4.0\\n \\nis not just \\nmassive advances in technology will also come with a transformation of the existing \\nrelationships in the production process \\n(Brown\\n-\\nMartin, 2018; Soh and Connolly, 202\\n0). \\nIndustry 4.0\\n \\nis allowing the manufacturing sector to be in the class of the information age \\nthrough permitting communication at all the stages of production\\n.\\n \\nAlso, industry 4.0 is \\ninitiating new economic form in many sectors, the sharing economy (Mhlan\\nga, 2020\\na\\n, \\nMhlanga \\nand Moloi, 2020b\\n, \\nKravchenko and Kyzymenko, 2019\\n).\\n \\nS\\nervices \\nsuch as \\nshared\\n \\nbasketballs \\nand toys;\\n \\ntransport\\n \\nthis shows how revolutionary the shared economy will become in the \\nindustry 4.0 (Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020a).\\n \\nOn the other hand, som\\ne researchers believe that industry 4.0 will result in more inequality due \\nto its threat in disrupting labour markets. It is argued the continuous growth in automation, \\nrobots and computers will take the jobs of workers in many industries (Berce, 2016). Th\\ne most \\nworrying aspect is that there is the increased danger of the disappearance of low\\n-\\nskill/low\\n-\\npay \\njobs which will cause a lot of challenges for the poor which will lead to a\\n \\nrise in\\n \\nsocial tensions \\n(Davis, 2016). However, in its strict sense, the issu\\ne of inequality is not unique to the industry \\n4.0, in history, all other previous revolutions always started with \\nhuge \\ninequality followed\\n \\nby \\nperiods of political and institutional change \\n(Schwab, 2017). However, the most worrying fact \\nis that in the \\nindustry 4.0 it is not only the movement of labour from one sector of the economy \\nto another but the existence of robots and computers that will replace human capital in short, \\ntaking the jobs of people. (Schwab, 2015, 2017). The other aspects the technolo\\ngical revolution \\nwill have an impact on are issues related to material or ideological changes caused by the \\nintroduction of new devices or new systems which will have an impact on reshaping the culture \\nof humankind. Figure 1 below explains the four industr\\nial revolutions from the first to the \\ncurrent revolution.\\n Preprints  (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 16 September 2020                    doi:10.20944/preprints202009.0362.v1', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/preprints202009.0362.v1.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

On the other hand, Hae\\nnlein & Kaplan (2019) \\nstated that \\n“\\nalthough it is difficult to pinpoint the roots of AI, however, it is possible to trace \\nback to the 1940s, specifically 1942, when the American Science Fiction writer Isaac Asimov \\npublished his short story Run around. The \\nplot of Run around a story about a robot developed \\nby the engineers. The word “Artificial Intelligence” was then officially coined in 1956 Marvin \\nMinsky and John McCarthy one of the computer scientists at Stanford\\n”.\\n \\n \\nThe term artificial intelligence is exp\\nlained as the investigation \\n“\\nof intelligent problem\\n-\\nsolving \\nbehaviour and the creation of intelligent computer systems. In other words, AI describes the \\nwork processes of machines that would require intelligence if performed by humans\\n”\\n \\n(Wisskirchen et al., 2017).

With weak AI “the computer is merely an instrument for \\ninvestigating cognitive processes the computer simulates intelligence”.

It is believed that AI ranges from machines which can think to search \\nalgorithms used to play board games. In other words, it is insinuated that AI has applications \\nin nearly all ways humans use computers in society. AI \\nis used in subtler ways which include \\nexamining purchase histories as well as influencing marketing decisions (Benko and Sik Lányi, \\n2011).

This means that poverty is not a direct result \\nof one factor but a combination of factors. As a result, the United Nations (UN) defined poverty \\nin two aspects which are the absolute poverty and overall poverty. Absolute \\npoverty is defined \\nas a condition where people are \\ndeprived of basic human needs \\nlike\\n \\nfood, health, shelter, safe \\ndrinking water, sanitation facilities, education and information\\n \\n(Davids and Gouws, 2010; D \\nMhlanga, 2020\\nb\\n). As a result, \\npoverty\\n \\nis as a resu\\nlt of many \\nfactors\\n,\\n \\nnot\\n \\nonly income (Davids \\nand Gouws, 2010). \\nAlso\\n, overall poverty is defined as a condition where people are not able to \\nhave access to income and other productive resources. Overall poverty is characterised but not \\nlimited \\n“\\nto hunger\\n \\nand\\n \\nmalnutrition, ill\\n-\\nhealth, inability to access education, a rise in morbidity \\nand mortality from illness, shortage of housing, unsafe environments, social exclusion and \\ndiscrimination\\n”\\n \\n(Davis and Sanchez\\n-\\nMartinez, 2015).  Overall poverty also \\n“\\ninvolves \\na \\nlack of \\nparticipation in decision making in civil, social and cultural life\\n”\\n \\n(Davis and Sanchez\\n-\\nMartinez, 2014). \\n \\nThe UN also came up with another definition of poverty, the multidimensional poverty index \\n(Mhlanga, 2020\\nb\\n). The definition by \\nthe \\nUN in 2010 \\ninvolves many issues such as \\neducation, \\nhealth, standards of living and many other variables.

Peric, \\n(\\n2015) \\nstated that the benefits of digital financial inclusion \\naccess to formal financial services by the \\npoor people those who were \\nfinancially excluded\\n, the other benefit is that, digital financial \\ninclusion helps to preserve the disposable incomes of the households because \\ndigital financial \\nservices and products are \\nusually \\noffered at a lower cost to the customer and the \\nservice \\nprovider.\\n \\nThe use of AI \\nalso allows customers to be able to \\ntransact in irregular \\nsmall\\n \\namounts \\nto assist them to manage their uneven incomes (\\nMhlanga, 2020a, \\nKoh, Phoon and Ha, 2018).\\n \\nThe other benefit of digital financial \\nservices is that it helps to reduce the risks\\n \\nof loss, t\\nheft, \\nand other financial crimes posed by cash\\n-\\nbased transactions\\n \\n(\\nMhlanga, 2020a; \\nMuneeza, \\nArshad and Arifin, 2018). \\nAlso, digital financial inclusion promotes economic\\n \\nempowerment \\nby \\nallowing the accumulation of\\n \\nasset\\ns\\n \\nfor women\\n, the youth, and the rural\\n \\npeople which \\nincreas\\nes\\n \\ntheir economic participation (\\nMhlanga, 2020a; \\nDavid\\n-\\nWest, 2015). \\n \\n5.\\n \\nConclusions \\nand Policy Recommendations\\n \\nThe purpose of the study was to critically investigate the influence on AI on poverty\\n \\nreduction\\n.\\n \\nThrough using content \\nanalysis, t\\nhe study found out \\nthat AI\\n \\nis\\n \\nincreasingly\\n \\ndelivering real value \\ndue to the availability of \\nbig and \\nrelevant data. AI is becoming central in the debate on how to \\nfight poverty and hunger in areas of data collection through poverty maps, agricult\\nure, \\neducation, and financial inclusion. It is believed that countries are not collecting as much data \\nand scaling up traditional household surveys to identify the number of poor people and the \\nregions where these people are located. However, AI is assisti\\nng to change this scenario. The \\nresearch team at Stanford University is using satellite images to provide an alternative to map \\npoverty, to identify the regions where poverty is more concentrated. Also, through the use of \\nrobotics and AI programs such as G\\noogle and Stanford University’s Sustainability and \\nArtificial Intelligence Lab, are coming forth with AI programs in agriculture which are doing \\na lot to improves farming, helping in the identification of diseases, prediction of crop yields \\nand location of\\n \\nareas prone to a scarcity among several other notable progress in education. \\nTherefore,\\n \\nthe study recommends that governments, development institutions and other Preprints  (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 16 September 2020                    doi:10.20944/preprints202009.0362.v1', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/preprints202009.0362.v1.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

This trend is also seen to \\nevolve in the field of socioeconomic studies, with an individual or household economic and social status relative to the rest of society. Is this technology present \\nin the field of socioeconomic especially in poverty measurement? What is the form \\nof problem solved? Therefore, the authors try to answers these question through systematic review method from the existence of poverty measurement research \\nuntil the beginning of 2019. A systematic literature search was performed in the \\nWeb of Science and Scopus to identify all potential relevant studies using \\nKitchenham, 2007 guideline. Of the 53 article documents, 15 papers were selected \\nafter subsequent title/abstract and full text screening related to poverty \\nmeasurement. The findings show that Linear Regression is a popular method \\nchosen and closely followed by Random Forest and Deep Learning. Most studies \\ndiversify the use of data sources to predict poverty more accurately. The tendency \\nto use satellites data can be seen more significantly than other types of data. \\nOverall from 2007 to early 2019, the potential for using AI in the socioeconomic remains open. \\n \\n \\n1. Introduction \\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is the machine simulation of the process of human intelligence. Since 1956, \\nit has been a fairly established research area that attempted to solve complex computer device problems \\n[1]. In recent years, there have been increasing interesting research attempts to use AI such as machine \\nlearning (ML) [2-4,11-13], image recognition [14 –23], speech recognition [24 –27], natural language \\ngeneration [28 –31], sentiment analysis [32 –37], neural networks [19,29] and deep learning [38 –40] in \\nmany disciplines such as security [41 –48], health care [49 –51], medical [52 –56], e-commerce [57], \\nmanagement [57], smart cities [58], big data [41,43,47,58 –60] and such. Artificial intelligence slowly \\nembarks in socioeconomic domain including measuring poverty. \\nPoverty was a problem that faced by many developing countries. Poverty must first be identified \\nand calculated to eradicate it. This is achieved using indices of poverty that fall into two main categories: monetary indices of poverty and non-monetary indices of poverty [61]. Monetary indexes are based on local or foreign currency monetary income indicators and include the different national poverty lines. \\nIn the meantime, non-monetary indices depend on wealth proxies and estimate the severity of \\ndeprivation by depriving one of the proxies mentioned. One such non-monetary index is the multi- dimensional poverty index (MPI) developed at the University of Oxford. These indices however mostly \\nuse statistical method since then. In many ways, the evolution of Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0) also \\nprovides an opportunity for inequality to use it as an irradiated to define poverty levels differently. How \\nfar this evolution has been benefited by poverty area? This study will reveal the past studies by using \\nSystematic Literature Review (SLR).

Statistical \\nmethods may or may not be used to analyse and summarize the findings of the studies included. [62] \\nThe authors' assertions of rigor in their work can be supported by a systematic review, which makes it \\npossible to identify shortcomings and priorities for future research. \\nThis study sets to achieve three objectives namely i. Review and identify research related to poverty \\ntracking using AI methodology ii. Identify machine learning algorithm used for poverty measurement \\niii. Identify type of data has been used and what kind of task relevant has been used to achieve poverty \\nidentification. The next section describes the method of review using SLR while the findings are \\nhighlighted in the next section. A summary proceeds with the results of the SLR focused on proof \\nsynthesis. Finally, with conclusion, the last section ends. \\n \\n2. Methodology \\nThe review processes for this SLR used the guidelines proposed by [63,64]. According to [63], SLR is \\nactive in three main phases; review preparation, evaluation and reporting;. The process stages summary \\nas in Figure 1. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.

As such, periodic \\nmeasurements are conducted through Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS)  twice every five years, and \\nsubsequently used to generate a Poverty Line Income (PLI)  to determine poverty levels through statistical methods. Such \\nuni-dimensional measurement however is unable to portray the overall deprivation conditions, especially based on the \\nexperience of the urban population.

In view of this, a \\npotential use of Machine Learning (ML) approaches that can produce new poverty measurement methods is therefore of \\ninterest, which must be triggered by the existence of a rich database collection on poverty, such as the eKasih database \\nmaintained by the Malaysian Government. The goal of this study was to determine whether ensemble learning method \\n(random forest) can classify poverty and hence produce multidimensional poverty indicator compared to based learner \\nmethod using eKasih dataset.

It begun since \\n1957, to ensure that the development of a country is broad \\nto the bottom level of citizens (poor people). In 2016, \\nMalaysia managed to reduce poverty to 0.4% as compared to 49.3% in 1970 (Prime Minister Office Malaysia 2015) \\n(The Economic Planning Unit 2017). This showed that \\nMalaysia has successfully eradicated poverty level to its \\nbare minimum. However, the economic growth indices \\nhave shown not much reduction in the level of poverty of \\nthe poor, hence, there is a need for inclusiveness (World-', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ARTIKEL 24.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='448\\nBank 2013). In order to achieve inclusiveness, \\nmultidimensional poverty index was introduced by Oxford \\nPoverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI)  and \\nUnited Nation Development Programme (UNDP) , which \\nis being published annually by the Human Development \\nReport Office from 2010 to measure poverty from various \\nperspectives (Lucci et al. 2018).\\nThe measurement method of poverty is crucial to the \\ngovernment for developing and empowering policy. As \\nsuch, there is a need for a good and trusted method to \\nestablish a strong accuracy in classifying poverty. Due to \\nthis, the Malaysia poverty measurement, a poverty line \\nincome (PLI)  was created to employ the use of statistic \\nmethod Gini Coefficient through based on basic costs of \\nthe items (Jamil & Mat 2014). The government of Malaysia \\nmade initiative to improve the cost of living, quality of \\nlife, and wellbeing of the nation by applying \\nmultidimensional poverty index that is comparable to the \\nrelative poverty measurement approach practiced by \\ndeveloped countries in the Eleventh Malaysian Plan \\n(11MP) 2016-2020 (Economic Planning Unit 2015). The \\ninitiative was aimed to precisely identify the group of lower \\nincome that is below the Bottom 40% (B40) income group. \\nTable 1 shows the multidimensional indicator listed by \\ngovernment to classify poverty using the statistic method.\\n In 2007, the eKasih - Poverty Bank of Malaysia was \\ndeveloped to keep all information about poor, hard core \\npoor and B40 income group. The B40 community in the \\n11MP is defined as a household with a mean monthly \\nincome of MYR 2,537 (Unit Perancang Ekonomi 2015) and \\naccording to latest Household Expenditure and Income \\nSurvey (HEIS)  2016, the B40 mean income is MYR 4,360 \\n(DOSM  2017. These bulks of data may have potential knowledge to classify new poverty indicator using machine \\nlearning (ML)  method.\\nClassification problems have been widely discussed \\nby researches in many contexts and domain. It reflects the \\nbenefits and discovery of new technique in data analysis. \\nAccuracy and precision in data classification is vital and \\nhas been applied in many disciplines, such as medical \\n(Husam et al. 2017; Pavithra & Sudha 2018; Nor Samsiah \\net al. 2018a), meteorology (Chen et al. 2018; Doycheva et \\nal. 2017; Natita et al. 2017; Wrzesień et al. 2019; Zhong \\net al. 2019), image recognition (Albashish et al. 2016; Wu \\net al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2019), customer \\nsegmentation (Adomavicius & Tuzhilin 2001; Alsac et al. \\n2017; Vafeiadis et al. 2015) and increasingly popular in \\nsocio-economic (poverty, household, living standard) \\nfields. Some methods of ML that have been experimented \\nin socio-economic domain are random forest (Sohnesen \\n& Stender 2016; Thoplan 2014), logistic regression \\n(Kshirsagar et al. 2017), linear regression (Sohnesen & \\nStender 2017), convolutional neural network (Jean et al. \\n2016; Perez and Azzari 2017, K-means (Deng et al. 2016; \\nSano & Nindito 2011) and K-nearest neighbour (Santoso \\n& Mohammad Isa 2016). However, the success of ML in \\nthe studies discussed above led to the usage of the ML \\nmethods in developing a poverty classification model in \\nthis research.\\nThis study attempts to investigate random forest (RF) \\nmethod, which was claimed to have good performance in \\nSohnesen and Stender (2016)’s as well as Thoplan (2014) \\nstudies using Malaysian data. Apart from that, this study \\nwas also conducted to extract important variables from the \\nmodel that can contribute to multi-dimensional poverty \\nindicator.\\nTABLE  1.

The final section would \\nconclude the overall findings and suggestion for future \\nwork.\\nRELATED WORK IN POVERTY\\nPOVERTY MEASUREMENT IN MALAYSIA\\nAbsolute poverty is defined as the number of people who \\nare unable to order adequate assets to fulfill their essential \\nneeds (Mohamed Saladin et al. 2011). However, economists \\nhave concurred that poverty does not have one direct idea. \\nTherefore, the poverty measurement approach also varies \\nby countries. \\nThere are many poverty measurement approach, such \\nas monetary approach, capability approach, social \\nexclusion and poverty participatory assessment (PPA)  \\n(Harun & Abdullah 2007). Poverty in Malaysia is often \\nconceptualised and operationalised from the monetary \\napproach, according to basic costs of items (Jamil & Mat \\n2014). The amount of money needed to fulfill basic needs \\nis known as Poverty Line Income (PLI) . Poverty occurs \\nwhen the income of the household’s head is lower than \\nPLI. These measurements are revised once every two years \\nthrough survey findings, Household Expenditure and \\nIncome Survey (HEIS) . The PLI or commonly known as \\nthe poverty threshold in Malaysia is determined by the \\nEconomic Planning Unit (EPU)  of the Prime Minister’s \\nDepartment. Currently, PLI in Peninsular Malaysia is \\nMYR 960, Sabah MYR 1,180 and Sarawak MYR 1,020 \\n(Jabatan Perangkaan Malaysia 2017). Malaysia uses Gini \\nCoefficient (Jabatan Perangkaan Malaysia 2017) as the \\nmain method for measuring poverty level. Table 2 shows \\nthe PLI of 2016.\\nPOVERTY CLASSIFICATION USING                             \\nMACHINE LEARNING\\nSeveral studies have shown that random forest (RF) could \\ncontribute better prediction for poverty. Sohnesen and Stender (2017) experimented using RF in six countries, \\nwhich are Ethiopia, Malawi, Uganda, Albania, Tanzania, \\nand Rwanda where the study found that RF is more \\naccurate than multi imputation (MI) method using Stata. \\nRF used 25 variables with highest importance score rather \\nthan MI and selected 81 to 132 variables. This small RF \\nmodel leads to improved accuracy in four out of the six \\ncountries.\\nMcBride and Nichols (2016) analysed RF’s \\nperformance and compared the result with the existing \\nregression-based models for developing proxy-means-test \\ntargeting models. The assessment was created for United  \\nStates Agency for International Development (USAID)  to \\ninvestigate out-of-sample accuracy in three countries, \\nwhich are Bolivia, Timor-Leste, and Malawi. In which they \\nnoticed that quantile RF is not considerably higher at \\npredicting the economic condition standing of households \\nMcBride. Thus, it concluded that RF considerably improves \\nout-of-sample performance by 2-18 percent. Even if \\nquantile RF is higher at properly estimating a poor house \\nas poor, it still has higher wrong classification of a non-poor \\nhouses to be poor. \\nBambang Widjanarko and Dian Seftiana (2015) \\nnoticed that an RF technique is working correctly in \\ndistinguishing qualified poor households for social \\ninsurance packages in Indonesia, whereas Thoplan (2014) \\nfound that associate application in Mauritius uses RF to \\nidentify economic condition predictors and found out that \\nRF predicts economic condition accurately. However, none \\nof these studies discussed about the feature’s importance.\\nUnlike other literatures, in the study of Nor Samsiah \\net al. (2018b), eight features were determined and ranked \\nby feature selection to improve bottom 40 percent (B40) \\nhousehold in Malaysia. According to 11 MP, B40 is a \\nhousehold that earns income less than RM3,855 per month \\n(Economic Planning Unit 2015), which covers poor and \\nhardcore poor household. The eight features selected were \\ntotal income, average monthly income, income per capita, \\nstate, date of record, area, ethnic and household number \\n(Nor Samsiah et al. 2018b). It was observed that Decision \\nTree (J48) performed better accuracy rather than Naïve \\nBayes and K-Nearest Neighbour. Feature selection defining \\nwere importance in having model higher accuracy \\naccording to Nor Samsiah et al. (2018b).\\nTABLE  2.

A total of 196,650 \\nobservations and 24 variables were used; where 2 variables \\nrepresent household information, 2 variables represent \\nincome, 3 variables represents health information, 9 \\nvariables represent the location of household and others \\nrepresent household demographic. Out of these 24 \\nvariables, 15 variables were selected based on literature review. Detail information about eKasih dataset can be \\nseen in Table 3.\\nDATA PREPARATION\\nIn this dataset, there are 1,105 missing values. All these \\nmissing values occur in 3 variables which are; per capita \\nincome, health and HDER eg. According to literature \\nreview, per capita income is one of the main variables \\nacting as predictor in poverty classification. Thus, the \\nsubject matter expert suggests replacing missing value for \\nper capita income with zero. For another two variables \\nhealth and HDER eg, NA imputation was imposed. All data \\ntype in dataset was converted to numeric for modelling \\npurposes. Description of before and after pre-processing \\ndata are shown in Table 4. \\nIn order to have a better understanding about the \\ndataset after pre-processing, exploratory analysis was \\nconducted to see the correlations among the variables using \\nPearson’s Correlation technique. The variables were \\nplotted to check if there are a strong collinearity. According \\nto Pearson’s, 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no \\nlinear correlation, and -1 is total negative linear correlation \\nbetween two variables (Laradji et al. 2014).\\nAs shown in Figure 2, it was observed that not all \\nvariables were correlated. Variables that have positive \\ncorrelation with poverty status as well as strong relationship \\nare; per capita income, education, ethnicity, occupation, \\nage, marital status, gender and health. These strong positive \\ncorrelation means for every positive increase in one \\nvariable, there is a positive increase of a fixed proportion \\nin the other. While negative correlation variables are; \\ndisability, religion, strata, total members and state. It means \\nfor every positive increase in one variable, there is a \\nnegative decrease on a fixed proportion in the other. \\nHowever, HDER eg has zero correlation with poverty status, \\nwhich means for every increase, there is not a positive or \\nnegative increase.\\nFIGURE  2.

It consists \\nof a collection of tree-structured classifiers {h(x, ?k), k = \\n1,...} where the {?k} are independent identically distributed \\nrandom vectors and each tree casts a unit vote for the most \\npopular class at input x (Breiman 2001). \\nThe RF algorithm is bagging ensemble classifier. It \\nruns fast and is considered to have relatively high accuracy \\ncompared to other classification algorithm (Thoplan 2014). \\nLeo Breiman was the first to formally introduce the RFs \\nafter the bagging method which is a combination of models \\nin view of increasing classification accuracy. RF can \\novercome the overfitting problem because of a large \\nnumber of trees, the generalization error converges to a \\nlimiting value under the strong law of large number \\n(Breiman 2001).\\nSteps of RFs algorithm are outlined as follows:\\nA random sample of observations is taken and subsequent \\nbootstrap samples for other trees are taken; A subset of m \\nvariables that is much less than the total number of variables \\nin the dataset is randomly selected using the Gini score, and \\nthus the best split is determined; and The out-of-bag (OOB) \\nprediction is obtained through a majority vote across trees \\nwhose observation is not included in the bootstrap sample.\\nAlso, RF is capable of providing a ranking of \\nvariable importance. In order to evaluate the importance \\nof a variable, Louppe et al. (2013) proposed to evaluate, \\nfor all trees in the forest, the average of an impurity \\ndecrease measure for all nodes where the variable is \\nconcerned. The variable with the largest decrease in \\nimpurity will be considered as the most important \\nvariable. This can be achieved through the Mean \\nDecrease Gini (MDG)  or the Mean Decrease Accuracy \\n(MDA) . In this paper, we focus mainly on the MDG  to \\nidentify important variables.\\nUsing the notations from Louppe et al. (2013), any \\nmean decrease impurity measure can be mathematically \\nrepresented as follows:\\n  (1)\\nFrom (1), represents the Xm variable, NT is the number \\nof trees in the forest, is the variable at split st, p(t) is the \\nproportion of records at node t out of the total number of \\nrecords in the data and\\n  (2)\\npL represents the number of records in the left child \\nnode of t out of the total number of records at node t. For this study, we shall consider the impurity measure i(t) as \\nthe Gini index. The Gini index, i(t) is defined as follows \\nfor a node t:\\n   (3)\\nwhere j = 1, 2 for this study representing poverty \\nclass.\\nDECISION TREE\\nThe decision tree is a well-known classifier that presents \\nthe output in a tree structure. The tree represents a test on \\na variable, where each branch denotes an outcome of a test \\nand each leaf at the end of the branch is the output of a \\nclass label.\\nThe topmost node in a tree is the root node (Wu et al. \\n2015). Given a tuple,  X, for which the associated class \\nlabel is unknown, the attribute values of the tuple are tested \\nagainst the decision tree. A path is then traced from the \\nroot to a leaf node, which holds the class prediction for \\nthat tuple. Decision tree classifiers have good accuracy \\n(Yang & Fong 2011).\\nSteps of this algorithm are given as follows. \\nInput: Data partition, which is a set of training tuples and \\ntheir associated class labels; Variables list, the set of candidate \\nvariables; and Variables selection method, a procedure to \\ndetermine the splitting criterion that ‘best’ partitions the data \\ntuples into individual classes.\\nOutput: A decision tree.\\nMODEL EV ALUATION\\nAccuracy:  It is a ratio of ((no. of correctly classified \\ninstances) / (total no. of instances)) × 100) (Nor Samsiah \\net al. 2018a) and it can be defined as: \\n( )\\n100*ve) TrueNegati tive (FalseNega ive) FalsePositive (TruePositve TrueNegative TruePositi\\nAccuracy+ + ++\\n=\\nConfusion Matrix : Show the number of correct and \\nincorrect classification of test dataset break into each class \\n(Ahmad & Abu Bakar 2018).

True negatives (TN):There are \\ndata predicted as Class 2 and actual data are also Class 2. \\nFalse positives (FP): There are data predicted as Class 1 \\nbut actual data are in Class 2 (Also known as a ‘Type I \\nerror’). False negatives (FN): There are data predicted as \\nClass 2 but actual data are in Class 1 (Also known as a \\n‘Type II error.’).', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/ARTIKEL 24.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

It is generated from test dataset \\nby plotting the  TP Rate and FP Rate. The formula for ROC \\nis as follows (Othman et al. 2018):\\nWithin the ROC, different threshold can be determined \\nby the users, where it will show either the classification \\nincreases to FP or TP. Also, ROC graph is used to visualise \\nthe result. The quality of ROC is often summarized as a \\nsingle number using the area under the curve (AUC) , but \\nhigher AUC  scores are better. Figure 3 shows the example \\nof ROC graph. \\nFIGURE  3. ROC Graph\\nRESULTS AND KNOWLEDGE ANALYSIS\\nMACHINE LEARNING PERFORMANCE: ACCURACY , \\nCONFUSION MATRIX AND ROC\\nThe classification of poverty starts by dividing a poverty \\ndataset into two sets (training and test set). The training \\nset consists of a 75% sample of variables and targeted class \\nfrom the dataset. While others are used as test sets. \\nExperiment output from this dataset is discussed in this \\nsection.Modelling poverty classification starts with RF method \\nby setting numbers of tree ( n) to grow set to 100. Poverty \\nStatus variables were selected as a class label to train the \\ntraining dataset. \\nWith n=100, confusion matrix for RF shows that \\n46,985 data were predicted as TP and 100,135 data as FN, \\nwhich means correctly predicted. However, only 53 data \\nwere predicted as TN and 314 data as FP mean incorrectly \\npredicted.\\nThis gave accuracy of 99% to the model with out of \\nbag (OOB)  estimate error calculated as 0.25% within 21.88 \\nsecond processing time. This small error of OOB  shows \\nfewer mistakes in the prediction of overall training sample.\\nAccording to Breiman (2001), 500 number of tree is \\na default value of having a good RF modelling. However, \\nit may consume time and require high computational \\npower. Figure 4 shows that the errors will decrease when \\nmore trees are iterated for this experiment. Green line \\nshows the error rate decrease when the number of variables \\nrandomly samples as candidate at each split ( mtry) is equal \\nto 1. However, the error rate is lesser when the mtry is \\nequal to 0. Hyper parameter, such as mtry and n can be \\ntuning for having a better performance of model.\\nFIGURE 4. Error rate reduced when the number                          \\nof trees is larger\\nThe poverty classification model is the decision tree \\n(J48), the based learner. The output form decision tree \\nmethod is a tree, as the tree is very easy to interpret and \\nunderstand especially for domain expert. Figure 5 shows \\nthe decision tree for this experiment and Table 6 \\nsummarises all eight rules extracted from the tree. \\nThis decision tree model also can be pruned according \\nto strata either urban or rural.

Decision Tree Diagram for urban poverty \\nclassification\\nFrom these figures, it is observed that the eight rules \\nfrom the tree are divided into two main poverty class \\n(hardcore poor and poor). Four rules were used to classify \\nhardcore poor and four rules to classify poor.\\nThese rules are able to translate the Malaysia Poverty \\nLine Income (PLI)  2014 as presented in Table 7. However, \\nthe per capita income threshold is slightly higher, especially \\nfor poor status in Table 7 due to sampling error in the data \\nset. \\nThe confusion matrix for decision tree shown in Table \\n8 clearly indicates that this model is able to predict \\ncorrectly 15,683 as TP and 32,642 as TN, and incorrectly \\npredicted only 832 as FN and 6 as FP. With this very high TP and TN correctly predicted, accuracy for this model is \\n98% with only 2.17 s processing time. Table 8 shows the \\ncomparative analysis of accuracy, confusion matrix, \\nprocessing time of the method.\\nFIGURE  7. Decision Tree Diagram for rural poverty \\nclassification\\nPerformance for both of these classifications can also \\nbe measured using ROC. ROC can show the sensitivity of \\nthe model towards correct and incorrect prediction by the \\nmodel. Figure 8 shows ROC for decision tree and RF model. \\nBoth ROC model is closer to left hand and top border, \\nrepresenting higher accuracy and sensitivity. AUC  value \\nfor RF is 0.9999, while AUC  for decision tree is 0.9975. \\nEven when the value different is quit slim, RF model \\nperforms slightly better than decision tree. \\nIMPORTANT V ARIABLES\\nDetermining important variable in this experiment is \\ncrucial to identify if there are variables that influence \\npoverty classification other than income. This is important \\nin leading us to build a multidimensional poverty indicator \\nto classify poverty. Conversely, RF algorithm has capability \\nto list important variables by using MDG  impurity \\ncalculation. Table 9 shows the rank of important variables \\nfrom the experiment. It can be observed that from out of \\n14 variables, per capita income, states, ethnic, strata and \\nreligion are the top five important variables in classifying \\npoverty.\\nWhile in decision tree model, important variables are \\ncalculated using Information Gain for chosen important \\nvariable as stated in Table 10.

The performance comparison presented in Table \\n14 shows that, accuracy percentage for the model remain \\nthe same. However, processing time to predict the poverty \\nclass is faster. Therefore, it is better to use these seven \\nimportant variables to classify poverty rather than selecting \\nall. \\nCONCLUSION\\nPoor and hardcore poor classifications using ML is a viable \\nmethod to determine and identify the poverty class. \\nSpecifically, the RF algorithm was shown to achieve higher \\naccuracy than a decision tree in poverty classification. \\nExperiments also showed that seven features were \\nidentified to be important variables, according to the mean \\nrank multi-method. These are Per Capita Income, State, \\nEthnic, Strata, Religion, Occupation and Education. \\nFurther experiments using these seven variables show \\nsimilar accuracy results with the advantage of less ML \\nruntime. Therefore, we conclude that dimension reduction \\nof the variables for ML is beneficial. Furthermore, multi-\\ndimensional poverty variables were able to classify poverty \\nwith higher accuracy compared to uni-dimensional poverty \\nclassification. The seven variables chosen are also in line \\nwith indicators outlined by the Malaysian Government in \\nthe 11th Malaysian Economic Plan. Leveraging from the \\nimpact of the recent data explosion, sectors involved with \\npoverty management stand to gain the benefit of improved \\naccuracy in poverty classification using ML technology. \\nThis allows poverty alleviation programs to be implemented \\nby government agencies, in order to identify the poor and \\nhardcore poor more effectively. Finally, aids can be given \\nto those in need with better clarity which will reduce the \\nissues of deprivation. It is therefore suggested that there \\nshould be further research that would be channelled \\ntowards the improvements of the RF method using greater \\nnumber of trees of more variables and multi-sourced data \\nto obtain more important variables for poverty classification. \\nFurthermore, variables that are not selected as important \\nin this experiment can be fused with other dataset \\nencompassing education, expenses and health domains to \\ngain a more useful knowledge. \\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nSpecial thanks to UKM  for providing the funding for this \\nproject under the grand challenge LAB40 research grant \\nof DCP-2017-015/1 and Implementation Coordination \\nUnit, Department of Prime Minister, Malaysia for the \\npositive cooperation given in this research.\\nREFERENCES\\nAdomavicius, G. & Tuzhilin, A. 2001.
