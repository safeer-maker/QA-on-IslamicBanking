Multidimensional measures of depriva-\\ntion are composed of different indicators fitting into a\\nsyntheticscale[ 9,10],whichisdeemedtoreflectbasic\\nliving standards and the exclusion from the minimum\\nacceptable way of life in one’s own society.\\nIn2010theMultidimensionalPovertyIndex( MPI),was\\nofficiallypublishedbyOxfordPovertyandHumanDevel-\\nopmentInitiative2incollaborationwithHumanDevelop-\\nmentReportOfficeof theUnitedNationsDevelopment\\nProgramme (UNDP) [ 11]. TheMPIconsiders poverty\\nthrough ten indicators divided into three dimensions:\\nhealth,educationandstandardofliving. Thedimensions\\nare equally weighted, and so are the specific indicators.\\nSeveral methodologies to assess poverty from a multi-\\ndimensionalperspectiveexist,includingmethodsaiming\\nto implement aggregate data from different sources, and\\nstatisticalapproaches– i.e.,principalcomponentanalysis,\\norclusteranalysis–whichreflectthejointdistribution\\nof single deprivation indicators and aim for a bottom-up\\ndefinitionofsyntheticscales[ 12].

Matrix 𝑌is thus mapped into a deprivation ma-\\ntrix𝐺 = [𝐺𝑘𝑗]ofvaluesbelongingtotherange [0,1],with\\nbinary values associated to categorical features obtained\\napplyingproperthresholdsandcontinuousrealvalues\\nfor numeric ones.

Background\\nPopulations in OECDcountries are ageing rapidly, their\\nhealth worsens, and they may struggle with everyday\\nactivities.

However,\\nincome-basedindicatorsarepoorproxiesofmaterialcon-\\nditionsamongtheelderly[ 5,6]whereasnon-monetary\\nonesimproveourunderstandingofwhoispoor,witha\\nshift from a unidimensional to a multidimensional ap-\\nproach [7],[8]. Multidimensional measures of depriva-\\ntion are composed of different indicators fitting into a\\nsyntheticscale[ 9,10],whichisdeemedtoreflectbasic\\nliving standards and the exclusion from the minimum\\nacceptable way of life in one’s own society.\\nIn2010theMultidimensionalPovertyIndex( MPI),was\\nofficiallypublishedbyOxfordPovertyandHumanDevel-\\nopmentInitiative2incollaborationwithHumanDevelop-\\nmentReportOfficeof theUnitedNationsDevelopment\\nProgramme (UNDP) [ 11]. TheMPIconsiders poverty\\nthrough ten indicators divided into three dimensions:\\nhealth,educationandstandardofliving. Thedimensions\\nare equally weighted, and so are the specific indicators.\\nSeveral methodologies to assess poverty from a multi-\\ndimensionalperspectiveexist,includingmethodsaiming\\nto implement aggregate data from different sources, and\\nstatisticalapproaches– i.e.,principalcomponentanalysis,\\norclusteranalysis–whichreflectthejointdistribution\\nof single deprivation indicators and aim for a bottom-up\\ndefinitionofsyntheticscales[ 12].

Matrix 𝑌is thus mapped into a deprivation ma-\\ntrix𝐺 = [𝐺𝑘𝑗]ofvaluesbelongingtotherange [0,1],with\\nbinary values associated to categorical features obtained\\napplyingproperthresholdsandcontinuousrealvalues\\nfor numeric ones.

Background Populations in OECDcountries are ageing rapidly, their health worsens, and they may struggle with everyday activities. The financial challenges faced by older people with Long-Term Care ( LTC) needs can be very high and absorb a significant amount of their income. Home care andsmallout-of-pocketpaymentsmaybeunaffordable without adequate social protection. Most studies emphasize the economic facet of poverty on the basis of monetary income [ 2,3,4]. However, income-basedindicatorsarepoorproxiesofmaterialcon- ditionsamongtheelderly[ 5,6]whereasnon-monetary onesimproveourunderstandingofwhoispoor,witha shift from a unidimensional to a multidimensional ap- proach [7],[8]. Multidimensional measures of depriva- tion are composed of different indicators fitting into a syntheticscale[ 9,10],whichisdeemedtoreflectbasic living standards and the exclusion from the minimum acceptable way of life in one’s own society. In2010theMultidimensionalPovertyIndex( MPI),was officiallypublishedbyOxfordPovertyandHumanDevel- opmentInitiative2incollaborationwithHumanDevelop- mentReportOfficeof theUnitedNationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) [ 11]. TheMPIconsiders poverty through ten indicators divided into three dimensions: health,educationandstandardofliving. Thedimensions are equally weighted, and so are the specific indicators. Several methodologies to assess poverty from a multi- dimensionalperspectiveexist,includingmethodsaiming to implement aggregate data from different sources, and statisticalapproaches– i.e.,principalcomponentanalysis, orclusteranalysis–whichreflectthejointdistribution of single deprivation indicators and aim for a bottom-up definitionofsyntheticscales[ 12]. Suchapproachesare adequate if they capture the joint distribution of depri- vations, identify the poor ones ( i.e., dichotomising the populationintopoorandnon-poor),andprovideasingle cardinal figure to assess poverty. Onlyrecently,thankstobigdataavailabilityandthe developmentofdatasciencetechniques, MLandAIhave been increasinglyadopted to povertyestimation. More- over,theCOVID-19pandemicledtoasignificantincrease inextremeglobalpovertywithrespecttothelast20years, 2ophi.org.ukaccordingtoreportspublishedbytheWorldBank[ 13], increasing the effort in defining predictive models. Besides the choice of the best algorithms, other cru- cial aspects, such as data quality and the presence of bias due to subjective and indirectly related data, exist, pushingtochoosingotherdatasourcessuchasremote sensingdatasets[ 14]. Asecondissueisrelatedtothedif- ficulties in finding labelled data. Ensemble models were employed, assuming as ground truth for MLtraining the Proxy Means Test ( PMT) labels, without verifying the accuracy of the PMTlabels [15]. Among different ML techniquesforpovertyclassification,decisiontree[ 16], random forest [ 15], and ensemble approaches [ 17] are the most used. 3. Dataset Theapproachpresentedherereliesonthe TAPASdataset (Time and Places and Space in Aging dataset)[ 18], pre- viously collected by Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neuro- logicoCarloBesta3andAuserLombardy4,bothcurrently involvedinthe AMPELproject5. Tocollectthedataset,a setofvalidatedtoolspreviouslydevelopedandusedin two projects [ 19,20] was administered to older people by trained interviewers to investigate various aspects of health, environment, social networks, and quality of life, resulting in a total of 744features (or variables) for each individual. The questionnaires were administered to 429 people aged 50or over. The features can be grouped into three categories:i) Categorical Features: variables which assume a fixed rangeofvalues( e.g.,privatehealthinsurancecoverage: yes or no); ii) Numeric Features: variables which assume numeric values, both discrete and continue ( e.g., heart rate: 84);andiii)RangeFeatures: variableswhichassume range values, ( e.g., ages: 60-75).

The AMPEL approach TAPASrepresents an excellent dataset to investigate poverty from a multidimensional perspective, thanks to thelargenumberoffeaturesusedtodescribeeachindi- vidual. However,thedatasetischaracterisedbyseveral issues, including the high number of NULLvalues, the lownumberofindividuals(429)comparedtothenumber offeatures(744)andthedifficultyinidentifyingthemost significant ones.

Multidimensional measures of depriva- tion are composed of different indicators fitting into a syntheticscale[ 9,10],whichisdeemedtoreflectbasic living standards and the exclusion from the minimum acceptable way of life in one’s own society.

Background\\nPopulations in OECDcountries are ageing rapidly, their\\nhealth worsens, and they may struggle with everyday\\nactivities. The financial challenges faced by older people\\nwith Long-Term Care ( LTC) needs can be very high and\\nabsorb a significant amount of their income. Home care\\nandsmallout-of-pocketpaymentsmaybeunaffordable\\nwithout adequate social protection.\\nMost studies emphasize the economic facet of poverty\\non the basis of monetary income [ 2,3,4]. However,\\nincome-basedindicatorsarepoorproxiesofmaterialcon-\\nditionsamongtheelderly[ 5,6]whereasnon-monetary\\nonesimproveourunderstandingofwhoispoor,witha\\nshift from a unidimensional to a multidimensional ap-\\nproach [7],[8]. Multidimensional measures of depriva-\\ntion are composed of different indicators fitting into a\\nsyntheticscale[ 9,10],whichisdeemedtoreflectbasic\\nliving standards and the exclusion from the minimum\\nacceptable way of life in one’s own society.\\nIn2010theMultidimensionalPovertyIndex( MPI),was\\nofficiallypublishedbyOxfordPovertyandHumanDevel-\\nopmentInitiative2incollaborationwithHumanDevelop-\\nmentReportOfficeof theUnitedNationsDevelopment\\nProgramme (UNDP) [ 11]. TheMPIconsiders poverty\\nthrough ten indicators divided into three dimensions:\\nhealth,educationandstandardofliving. Thedimensions\\nare equally weighted, and so are the specific indicators.\\nSeveral methodologies to assess poverty from a multi-\\ndimensionalperspectiveexist,includingmethodsaiming\\nto implement aggregate data from different sources, and\\nstatisticalapproaches– i.e.,principalcomponentanalysis,\\norclusteranalysis–whichreflectthejointdistribution\\nof single deprivation indicators and aim for a bottom-up\\ndefinitionofsyntheticscales[ 12]. Suchapproachesare\\nadequate if they capture the joint distribution of depri-\\nvations, identify the poor ones ( i.e., dichotomising the\\npopulationintopoorandnon-poor),andprovideasingle\\ncardinal figure to assess poverty.\\nOnlyrecently,thankstobigdataavailabilityandthe\\ndevelopmentofdatasciencetechniques, MLandAIhave\\nbeen increasinglyadopted to povertyestimation.

Asecondissueisrelatedtothedif-\\nficulties in finding labelled data. Ensemble models were\\nemployed, assuming as ground truth for MLtraining the\\nProxy Means Test ( PMT) labels, without verifying the\\naccuracy of the PMTlabels [15]. Among different ML\\ntechniquesforpovertyclassification,decisiontree[ 16],\\nrandom forest [ 15], and ensemble approaches [ 17] are\\nthe most used.\\n3.

The questionnaires were administered to 429\\npeople aged 50or over.\\nThe features can be grouped into three categories:i)\\nCategorical Features: variables which assume a fixed\\nrangeofvalues( e.g.,privatehealthinsurancecoverage:\\nyes or no); ii) Numeric Features: variables which assume\\nnumeric values, both discrete and continue ( e.g., heart\\nrate: 84);andiii)RangeFeatures: variableswhichassume\\nrange values, ( e.g., ages: 60-75).\\nFor more details about the dataset please refer to [ 18].\\n4.

These weights make it possible to label\\nthe individuals in the dataset according to the degree of\\npoverty: i) high, ii) medium or iii) low.\\nThe method starts by considering the initial dataset,\\nas a𝑛-by-𝑝matrix𝑌 = [𝑌𝑘𝑗], where𝑛is the number of\\nindividuals (n=429) and 𝑝the size of the selected feature\\nvector (p=99).\\nEach row of the matrix 𝑦𝑘= (𝑌𝑘1,...,𝑌𝑘𝑗,...,𝑌𝑘𝑝)gives\\nthe features of the 𝑘-th individual, while each column\\n𝑦𝑗= (𝑌1𝑗,...,𝑌𝑘𝑗,...,𝑌𝑛𝑗)gives the distribution of the 𝑗-th\\nfeature across individuals.\\nIt is important to note that the values of the 𝑌ma-\\ntrix are heterogeneous and can be ordinal, binary, or\\nnumeric. Matrix 𝑌is thus mapped into a deprivation ma-\\ntrix𝐺 = [𝐺𝑘𝑗]ofvaluesbelongingtotherange [0,1],with\\nbinary values associated to categorical features obtained\\napplyingproperthresholdsandcontinuousrealvalues\\nfor numeric ones. The mapping rules have been defined\\nby the domain expert. This expert knowledge permits todefine for each feature its deprivation level. An example\\nof this mapping is reported below.\\nFrom𝐺, summingovertherows,itispossibletocal-\\nculate a deprivation score 𝑐 = (𝑐1,...,𝑐𝑘,...,𝑐𝑛)for each\\nindividual. Thescorerepresentsthepovertyassociated\\nto each individual, so the higher the score, the more\\ndeprived the individual will be. However to better repro-\\nduce the reality, a vector 𝑣 = (𝑣1,...,𝑣𝑗,...,𝑣𝑝)of weights\\nshould be defined to properly consider the contribution\\nof each feature, where ∑𝑝\\n𝑗=1𝑣𝑗= 1and0 ≤ 𝑣𝑗≤ 1.\\nThusthe deprivation score 𝑐is obtained as:\\n𝑐 = 𝐺 ×𝑣⊤(1)\\nInsteadofdefiningasinglevectorofweights,following\\nLiberatietal.

The funeral director is responsible for carrying out the arrangements requested by \\nthe family and the deceased. However, it seems that the price of funerals is increasing year on \\nyear. The funeral business has become a mu lti-billion -dollar industry. As a result, many \\npeople cannot afford a funeral, which has a direct impact on funeral poverty. According to \\nIslamic teachings, it is desirable to bury the deceased as soon as possible rather than delaying \\nthe process in any wa y that can be avoided. Muslims in Malaysia feel more comfortable and \\nsupported by the Muslim burial organizations ( Badan Khairat Kematian ). Finding a solution \\nto the problem of funeral poverty among Muslims is the driving force behind this study . To \\nachieve the objectives of this study, a qualitative approach  was used, with in depth semi -\\nstructured interviews with seventeen Muslim funeral management organizations . The data \\nwas organized, coded, categorized and themes identified using ATLAS.ti version 22. The \\nfindings of the study show that the community -based ta'awun  model, which is based on the \\nconcept of mutual cooperation  and a deep understanding of fard kifayah  (community \\nobligation), and complemented by Waqf  (endowment), enables the provision of funeral \\nservices without profit and at minimal or no cost, thus alleviating funeral poverty in society . \\nThis study adds to the knowledge of a community -based paradigm to address funeral poverty \\nand funeral costs while enabling social and economic improvements in the community.  \\n  \\nKeywords: Funeral Poverty, Muslim Funeral,  Badan Khairat Kematian,  Community -based \\nModel  \\n \\nINTRODUCTION  \\nDeath is inevitable and it affects everyone. As the world's population ages, there will be more \\ndeaths, increasing demand for funeral services. This has led to a rise in the dominance of \\nfuneral homes. Funeral directors are the individuals that the bereaved family members assign \\nto handle the planning and execution of the funeral.  As the relatives of the deceased are \\nresponsible for planning and paying for the funeral, it is important to realize  that these services \\nare not cheap. The escalating cost of funeral services is a major problem in many countries. \\nEspecially in developed countries, the majority of funeral services and facilities are run by \\ncompanies. This trend has led to a significant i ncrease in funeral prices, which \\ndisproportionately affects low -income families (Audebrand & Barros, 2018; Drakeford, \", metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/VOL.-6-ISSUE-1-MARCH-2024-105-115.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ZAKAT AND ISLAMIC PHILANTHROPY ( MARCH  2024) \\n106 1998). According to Woodthorpe et al. (2013), some British  people are unable to pay for a \\nfuneral and therefore rely on various types of support, including government assistance. More \\nthan 10% of Americans struggle to pay for their funeral, even though the typical funeral costs \\nmore than $7,000 (NFDA, 2021).  Additionally , funeral costs in African countries are usually \\nfifteen times higher than the monthly income (Roth, 2001). According to Hay (2020), Corden \\nand Hirst (2015) and Valentine and Woodthorpe (2014), there is a growing body of research \\nshowing that \"funeral pove rty\" is a persistent problem in today\\'s society. This is mainly due \\nto the growing number of elderly people and the part of the population that does not have the \\nfinancial means to cover the costs of a funeral. This problem highlights how the funeral is a \\nfinancial burden on states and communities and contributes to inequality (Fletcher & \\nMcGowan, 2021).   \\nMany communities around the world are faced with the challenge of dying and the \\nfinancial constraints that come with it. Burial societies have emerged in response to the \\neconomic marginalization and cultural death customs seen in many African countries, th e \\nUnited Kingdom, the United States of America, Indonesia and including Malaysia. According \\nto Dafuleya (2013), community -based initiatives (CBIs) are activities in which members of a \\ncommunity participate to achieve a variety of goals, including but not limited to the following: \\nto provide for themselves and their extended fa milies, to save money for unexpected \\nsituations, or simply to help each other financially. Every village and town in Malaysia have \\nits own funeral organization, which has been around since the 1920s and is often referred to \\nas Badan Khairat Kematian . Both the funeral organizations and society as a whole are facing \\nchallenges due to the rising cost of funerals. To ensure the continuation of community service \\nand the achievement of societal goals, it is imperative that organizations find a creative \\nsolution to the problem of rising funeral costs. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore a \\nmodel for Muslim funeral services that can be implemented by Muslim funeral management \\norganizations. This model could help to end funeral poverty in the long term and enable all \\ncommunities, especially those with low incomes and unaffordable families, not to opt out and \\nthey can perform the last rite perfectly.  \\n \\nLITERATURE REVIEW  \\nFuneral Poverty  \\nIn recent years, there has been growing concern about \"funeral poverty\" among government \\nofficials and in the media in developed countries, including the United States of America \\n(USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia, but also in developing countrie s such as \\nAfrica. It symbolizes the challenge of covering the cost of a funeral and there is a clear link \\nbetween funeral poverty and financial hardship. Corden and Hirst (2015) describe funeral \\npoverty as the inability to pay for a funeral and the resulti ng negative psychological and \\nemotional impact on the bereaved, relatives and community members (including the impact \\nof loss and grief). Valentine and Woodthorpe (2014) note that a significant number of people, \\nparticularly in developed and African countr ies, are faced with the awful truth that the cost of \\na dignified funeral is beyond the financial means of relatives and friends of the deceased. \\nNowadays, people have to opt for less expensive cremations if they want to avoid the funeral \\npoverty trap (Moer man & van der Laan, 2021). People who are already in financial difficulty \\nface additional challenges due to insufficient income support and social benefits, as funeral \\ncosts are influenced by market forces. This exacerbates the inequalities that already ex ist.  ', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/VOL.-6-ISSUE-1-MARCH-2024-105-115.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ZAKAT AND ISLAMIC PHILANTHROPY ( MARCH  2024) \\n107 As previously mentioned, funeral poverty occurs when individuals do not have the \\nmeans or resources to pay for a funeral, which ultimately leads to over -indebtedness that is \\ndifficult to manage. According to Quarker Social Action (2017), funeral poverty ha s risen by \\n50% in the last three years. This increase can be attributed to a number of factors, including \\ninflation and the rising cost of living. In addition, a survey by the Fair Funerals Campaign \\n(2018) found that one sixth of the population do not have  the financial means to pay for funeral \\ncosts. Royal London (2018) showed that in the UK, twelve percent of respondents, equating \\nto seventy -five thousand people living in the UK, struggled to pay for a funeral in 2018. \\nAccording to their calculations, the  total cost of a funeral was £1,744, an increase of 4% on \\nthe previous year. In addition, it is estimated that Dundee City Council faces funeral costs of \\nhalf a million pounds each year.   \\nIn a study conducted in an African country, Roth (2001) examined twelve families in \\na township in the Eastern Cape and found that the average funeral costs for these people were \\nfifteen times their monthly income . The cultural significance of a funeral stems from the long -\\nstanding notion that the deceased accompany and honor the living. It places a considerable \\nfinancial burden on the host family when relatives travel for long periods of time to pay their \\nlast res pects to the deceased. Funerals are important cultural occasions in certain regions of \\nGhana where families display their wealth and social status. People of higher social status, \\nsuch as members of royal families, are known to have much more elaborate and  sophisticated \\nfuneral customs than the ordinary citizen. In Ghana, people close to the deceased can be \\npublicly humiliated, vilified and criticized if the funeral does not meet certain standards of \\nwhat is considered \"respectable\" in the country. Converse ly, some argue that the propensity \\nfor extravagant social spending, exemplified by the provision of costly funeral rites, could \\npotentially hinder the allocation of financial resources to vital areas such as education, \\nhealthcare,  and other indispensable requirements (Case et al., 2008, 2013; Chen & Zhang, \\n2014).  \\n \\nMuslim Funeral Management Organizations ( Badan Khairat Kematian)  in Malaysia  \\nInformal organizations such as burial societies offer a glimmer of hope for society when it \\ncomes to tackling the problem of funeral costs. To address economic marginalization and the \\ncomplex cultural implications of death, creative groups are coming toget her to form burial \\nsocieties and employ various strategies  that benefit the community as a whole.  Community -\\nbased groups in Malaysia or known as Badan Khairat Kematian  help the Muslim community \\nwith funeral arrangements , financial aid and grief counseling. These programs are \\ntraditionally conducted at the community level, with the mosque\\'s qaryah usually acting as \\nthe leader. In the past, this Khairat Kematian  was responsible for covering funeral expenses \\nthrough the community fund. The origins of this concept date back to 1926 when the Masjid \\nJelutong in Penang hosted the Pertubuhan Persekutuan al -Ikhwan al -Masakin  (Rofaizal et al., \\n2017). Giving back to the community to help members and their families is an important part \\nof this honorable group\\'s mission. Over the last three decades, the number of affiliated \\norganizations has steadily increased. Due to the altruis tic goals that certain organizations \\npursue, they have gained public attention.  The term \"mutual benefit” and  “mutual \\ncooperation” has caught on among the general public. It is traditional for the organizations \\nand the neighborhood to support each other by taking care of each other\\'s needs when a \\nmember of the mosque (a qaryah  member) or a family member passes away. The funeral ', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/VOL.-6-ISSUE-1-MARCH-2024-105-115.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

(2017), the term \" khairat \" or benevolence r efers to the Malay \\ncommunity\\'s long -standing tradition of putting Islamic teachings into practice. This tradition \\nemphasizes mutual aid, regardless of the origin or social status of those involved. Benevolence \\nand mutual assistance to the impoverished and destitute, especially through Waqf  and \\nalmsgiving, have become common practice in the Muslim faith (Ibhraim et al., 2021). The \\nconcept of khairat kematian  is like takaful as described in the study by Muhamat (2014) in \\nthat it involves a mutual obligation to support each other,  and contributions are motivated by \\ncharity rather than financial gain or maximizing returns. Ismail et al. (2019)  added , khairat \\nkematian  is a fund set up in Malaysia to pay for the funeral expenses of its members. To \\nprovide social protection, this charity fund is managed on a mutual basis by the community  \\ncommonly  associated with the mosque. Similar to the Takaful, voluntary contribution is a \\nrequirement for all members of this fund as well as those who are interested in becoming a \\nmember of this fund. On the other hand, the study by Masrukhin et al. (2022) shows that public \\nawareness and participation in this khairat kematian  has recently declined. This trend is \\nparticularly evident among the younger generation, suggesting that they are not adequately \\nprepared for the costs associated with death.  \\n \\nMETHODOLOGY  \\nThis study uses a qualitative approach to explore the community model by conducting in -\\ndepth semi -structured interviews with seventeen respondents representing Muslim funeral \\nmanagement organizations in Malaysia.  Each zone in Malaysia was represented by two \\nrespondents in the sample. The respondents were selected through a purposive sampling \\nprocess. They are closely involved in the technical or internal aspects of Muslim funerals, \\nsuch as funeral managers ( pengurus jenazah ) or board members of Muslim funeral \\norganizations. The use of qualitative research methods enables researchers to gain  rich \\ninformation  knowledge  and information  in a direct and expedient way.  The interview data was \\nthen subjected to a thematic analysis to identify the most important themes that should be \\naddressed to achieve the objectives of the study.  \\n \\nRESULT AND DISCUSSION  \\nCommunity -based Ta’awun  Model  \\nFard kifayah  is a communal obligation that certain individuals within a given society are \\nobligated to observe in order to promote the collective good. An example of an obligatory \\nfard kifayah  responsibility is the management of the Muslim funeral. After a person passes \\naway, there are a number of tasks that need to be done, such as washing, shrouding , praying \\nand burying the body. The Muslim community in the area is to blame if not a single person is \\nable to carry out these tasks. The people who live in that area should be responsible. According \\nto the statement of R15:  \\n \\n“…In fact, we are entrusted to manage funerals. Firstly, it is a fard kifayah \\nduty. If we fail to fulfil this duty, it means that others will bear the sin, and \\nwe also miss the opportunity to assist those in need. Therefore, we were \\nentrusted by the mosque a nd village authorities to establish a unit. I have \\nbeen doing this for a long time since the time of the village head, Pak Din ', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/VOL.-6-ISSUE-1-MARCH-2024-105-115.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

So, the concept is that we are \\nentrusted with the fard kifayah duty, which means that if the village \\nauthorities do not take care of it, it implies that other units will take care of \\nit. For example, we were entru sted with the responsibility of being aware of \\nwho passed away, whether at the end of the village or the middle of the \\nvillage. Once we know who passed away, we need to visit and inquire about \\nthe situation. So, we established an organization under the mos que that is \\nled by the Nazir ...”(R15)  \\n \\nIn his response to the question, respondent R15 emphasized the need to form a \\ncommittee or unit to handle funeral arrangements under the supervision of the mosque. In this \\nway, the community and the mosque have demonstrated their joint commitment to uphold ing \\nthe requirements of fard kifayah.  \\n \\n“…With the existence of this Waqf  fund, the convenience that death needs \\nto be facilitated is made easy and light. Okay, the concept is mutual \\nassistance ...” (R10)  \\n \\n“…It is the same. There was also a time during the month of Ramadan when \\nit was close to Maghrib, but we still do it. What can we do? It’s a fard \\nkifayah. When it is a fard kifayah, it must be fulfilled until it is completed …” \\n(R15)   \\n \\nThe explanations of  respondent  R15 and R10 shed light on the importance of \"mutual \\nsupport\" in relation to bereavement care. By implementing this idea, dealing with the deceased \\nbecomes easier and less complicated. It follows that the implementation of the fard kifayah  \\nrequirement of funeral arrangements must be collective as well as continuous and in line with \\nthe interests of the community. The fulfillment of this requirement of fard kifayah  does not \\nrest only on the shoulders of a single party; rather, all parties in the community are required \\nto work together and support each other to fulfill this responsibility to completion. \\nFurthermore, respondent  R10 mentioned that both the mosque and the community play an \\nactive role in carrying out the fard kifayah  in dealing with the deceased. It is possible that in \\naddition to the funeral arrangements, the community collaborates by collecting funds from the \\ncommunity members through the Waqf  fund or the  tabarru \\' fund. This can help to ease and \\nalleviate the considerable expenses associated with the management of funerals.  \\n \\n“…Actually, here we are considering another aspect of the fard kifayah. If \\nwe think of fard kifayah, it doesn’t end only in this world. Later in the field \\nof Mahsyar, we will be held responsible. That’s the reason why if there are \\nany costs we need to accomm odate, we say it’s okay the mosque will do it. \\nBut it depends on certain circumstances. We won’t accommodate \\neverything without any limits ...” (R6) \\n \\n“…This is a Fard kifayah obligation. Therefore, we are responsible for \\nmanaging it regardless of the circumstances. After all, they are our brothers \\nand sisters, regardless of which country they are from. We must prioritise \\nthis Fard kifayah obligation as it is a matter of welfare within the system …” \\n(R9)  ', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/VOL.-6-ISSUE-1-MARCH-2024-105-115.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

I do it as a \\ngoodwill gesture only. Sometimes they don’t even pay for the funeral van ...” \\n(R10)  \\n \\nFurthermore, as respondents R6, R9 and R10 indicated, human values and the well -\\nbeing of the individual must be paramount in fulfilling the fard kifayah  obligation. When \\ncalculating funeral costs, the profit motive should take a back seat to relieving the family and \\nhelping others, as respondent  R16 emphasized. This shows how important it is to approach  \\nfard kifayah with the right attitude and clearly defined goals. Both the interests of the \\nindividual and the interests of the community as a whole should be  considered when it comes \\nto managing funerals as a social obligation. Therefore, it is important to consider a number of \\naspects when calculating costs and expenses related to funerals, such as humanitarian and \\nsocial justice considerations, and not only economic motives.  \\n \\n“…Because this matter is primarily for the death charity, not for profit -\\nseeking purposes. We only aim to ease the burden of the deceased’s family. \\nOur actions are not based on seeking profit but rather on providing \\nassistance. However, at this point, when we ask for a payment, we are \\nsimply covering our own costs to ena ble us to help others …”  (R16)  \\n \\nThe family members who are financially able are responsible for the funeral costs. \\nHowever, for needy families, such asnaf  (persons eligible for zakat), orphans, impoverished \\nor disabled persons, the funeral organization and the mosque will jointly develop solutions \\nand offer financial support through social or donation funds. In order to alleviate the financial \\nburden of ben eficiaries who are unable to transfer the full amount, the mosque will provide \\nthem with support without charging the costs or fees.  \\n \\n“…We provide whatever assistance we can. If the deceased’s family is \\nclassified as asnaf, we will provide free services such as shrouding cloth, \\nand we won’t charge them. Here, the number of people who are unable to \\npay is low, but they are assisted by the residents’ association and the \\nmosque in the event of a death. Nobody ends up in debt because we work \\ntogether. The mosque is also ready to help if the family needs assistance or \\nif they have difficulty paying. We will lig hten their burden …” (R7)  \\n \\n“…Perhaps in some places, there are many welfare organizations that offer \\nassistance, so we only need to contribute a small amount …” (R9)  \\n \\nIn addition, respondents  R7 stated that they offer free services to needy families like \\nasnaf by providing them with free shrouds. To determine which families need support, the \\nmosque also keeps a list of those in need such as asnaf , impoverished and needy. The mosque \\nworks with charities and local community organizations to offer assistance and compensate \\nthe remaining families in a way that avoids indebtedness.   \\n \\n“…We are Masjid Syarifah Fatimah, and we primarily operate on a welfare \\nsystem, especially for financially challenged families. Therefore, we \\ndetermine the fair cost for underprivileged groups, such as asnaf, orphans, \\nthe destitute, and the poor. The mosque will provide free services for these \\ngroups, and we maintain a list of asnaf, the destitute, and the poor. When a \\ndeath occurs, we can trace the family’s status from our list. This is our first \\npriority. Secondly, we avoid making funeral management a bus iness. We ', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/VOL.-6-ISSUE-1-MARCH-2024-105-115.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

As a result, \\nthey can provide funeral services at a reasonable cost to the community while providing free \\nservices to financially disadvantaged groups such a s the elderly, orphans and the \\nunderprivileged. Due to their philanthropic nature, there is also disagreement that the mosque \\ndoes not view funeral services as a profitable business.  \\n \\nWaqf  (endowment) Practices in Muslim Funeral  \\nThe findings show that the cultural practices of Waqf  have long been a part of Malaysian \\nsociety. Many individuals have bequeathed their wealth or money as Waqf  to support religious \\nor charitable causes, e.g. lands usually used for community facilities such as schools, mosques, \\nsuraus, and cemeteries. This still has an impact on the development of society today. \\nAccording to R7 and R16, the state religious counci ls now have control over many of the \\ncemeteries that were established on Waqf  land by previous generations and are still in \\noperation today.  \\n \\n“…That was Waqf -ed by someone in the olden days. I think there is still \\nsome space for the Waqf  cemeteries ...” (R7)  \\n \\n“…The Waqf  land is not newly discovered. It had already been explored \\ndecades ago. However, regarding clearing the land, our Waqf  land is not \\nlike other Waqf  lands; it is already clean. We are still in stages. The unused \\narea still has a lot of overgrown vegetation. In other words, it is filled with \\ntrees. When we want to use it, we clear the area, level it, clean it, dig holes, \\nand so on before we use it …”  (R16)   \\n \\nIn many villages and qaryah mosques, there are Waqf  graves that benefit the local \\npopulation and surrounding communities. According to respondent R7, the Waqf  site has \\nexisted for a long time and there are still sites that could be used for graves. Respondent R16 \\nclaims that the area allocated to the cemetery is also quite large but has become badly in need \\nof restoration due to overgrowth of plants. The area o f this Waqf  site is large enough to meet \\nthe needs of the community, including burial plots. Waqf  cemeteries do not require annual or \\nmonthly lease payments, so they are available to a wide range of people without them having \\nto make a financial commitment.  \\nIn addition to the Waqf  for cemeteries, there are also Waqf  for funeral vehicles, which \\nwere purchased with the help of Waqf  donations from numerous private individuals. These \\nvehicles are intended to facilitate the transfer of the deceased from their place of residence to \\nthe cemetery.  \\n \\n“…A Waqf  van (vehicle) is parked at the mosque, which means it is up to \\nthe mosque management to decide whether to charge a fee for its use. \\nUsually, a reasonable fee is charged to cover the fuel cost per \\nkilometre ...”(R14)  \\n ', metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/VOL.-6-ISSUE-1-MARCH-2024-105-115.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ZAKAT AND ISLAMIC PHILANTHROPY ( MARCH  2024) \\n112 “…We currently have two funeral vans. So, if one is used outside of the \\nlocal area, the other will be on standby if there is a death in the local \\ncommunity. We have two vans. One was donated as Waqf  while the other is \\na Waqf  from an outside party …”(R9)  \\n \\nAs respondent  R14 noted, there is some leeway in the use of these Waqf  vehicles as \\nthe mosque management can decide whether or not to charge for the use of the vehicles. This \\nis an example of a practical approach to managing Waqf  assets where minimal or reasonable \\nfees can be charged to cover maintenance and operational costs such as fuel, road tax and \\nothers. With this strategy, the mosque administrator can avoid unnecessary operating costs \\nand ensure the continued usability of t he Waqf  vehicle, thereby ensuring its continued \\nusefulness to the community. In addition, according to the respondent R9, funeral \\norganizations or mosques with two funeral vehicles ( Waqf ) can extend their services to the \\ncommunity in urgent situations. This is especially true when deaths occur in close proximity \\nto the mosque or outside the city limits. For the benefit of the community in the area, the \\nreplacement vehicle can be used when  a specific vehicle is not nearby. In this way, the \\ntreatment process of the deceased can be optimized and accelerated.  \\nFurthermore , there is a dedicated Waqf  room, strategically positioned either in the \\ncommunity mosque or in the surrounding area, for the care of the deceased. This room serves \\nas a central location for the administration of the funeral.  \\n \\n“…We have a dedicated Waqf -ed room for managing funerals. This is \\nwhere the operations centre and HQ office are located near Sungai Udang \\nat the four -way junction. There are three locations, including the office, and \\nall official meetings are held there …”(R7)  \\n \\n“…Yes, we have a special room for managing the deceased. For example, \\nthere was a case where they asked us to go to their home. So, if it’s at home, \\nthey have to prepare a place, and we... we won’t go. We always say that if \\nthey want us to do it, they have t o come here and follow our SOP. That’s it. \\nIf you look down there, it’s easy. The van can enter directly and bring it out. \\nIt’s just in front, not far from the special room...” (R1)  \\n \\n“…We have our own special room. Nowadays, we don’t do it at home \\nanymore. We do it at the mosque. Just come to the mosque ...” (R6)  \\n \\nAccording to respondents R1, R6 and R7, most mosques have a room designated for \\nthe affairs of the deceased. In order to effectively carry out the tasks related to the deceased; \\nthis area is equipped with a comprehensive set of tools. In funeral preparatio n and \\nmanagement, this facility saves time and money.

So sometimes, the people of \\nJelutong put their deceased family members in the Jelutong mosque for \\nrelatives who come to pay their respects. They bathe them there, shroud \\nthem there, pray for them there, and bury t hem there. In the flat area, there \\nare four flats that have a managing room, starting from the mosque. The \\nMedan Tunku flat was the first to have a mortuary, followed by two, three, \\nand four flats that were followed by a mortuary to facilitate the manageme nt \\nof the deceased ...” (R8)  \\n \\nRespondent R8 pointed out that mosques and other places, including crowded \\nneighborhoods or cramped high -rise buildings, provide facilities for handling and preparing \\nthe deceased. This space for funeral preparation in these places greatly enhances the \\ncoordination of funeral procedures, including tasks such as washing, shrouding, and prayer. It \\nalso provides an appropriate space for relatives to come together and offer their condolences.  \\nMoreover, to the Waqf  for the assets, there is another Waqf  for the funeral items  such \\nas shrouds, which make up a significant portion of the cost of the funeral items.  \\n \\n“…Indeed, it will reduce costs. One of the costs that are sometimes reduced \\nis the cost of burial shrouds around here. Sometimes, the boss of Petronas \\ndonates a set of burial shrouds, so we get these Waqf -ed items, and that \\nreduces the costs. However, because he does not donate it regularly, it still \\ncauses the costs to remain unlowered …” (R3)  \\n \\nThe Waqf  for shrouds, a tradition that has been handed down, is still observed in many \\nplaces. The community can use the donated shrouds for a long time to come. In addition to \\nfulfilling vital social and funeral obligations, this approach can help reduce funeral costs. \\nAccording to R3, they accept Waqf  and donations in the form of shrouds, which are donated \\nby both private individuals and companies. Nevertheless, Waqf  for shrouds are not consistent \\nand do not occur very frequently. If funeral organizations, charities or mosques in charge of \\nthe funeral have a steady supply of shrouds, they can offer free shrouds, especially to \\neconomically disadvantaged families. This relieves the financial burden on the bereaved, \\nmaking it easier for them to get through this difficult time.  \\n \\nCONCLUSION  \\nIt can be concluded that a community -based model that embraces the principles of mutual aid \\nand support ( ta'awun),  a deep understanding of fard kifayah  and the practice of Waqf  \\n(endowment) has great potential for overcoming the problem of funeral poverty and ensuring \\nthat all people have access to more responsible and affordable funeral care. This paradigm \\npromotes social cohesion and mutual respect for shared responsibility in social and religious \\nspheres, including Muslim funeral care. The cost of funeral care can be reduced to the extent \\nthat all members of the community are able to bear it without being burdened by excessive \\ncosts if there is a culture of helping and contributing resources or assets to meet common \\nneeds. In this way, society is able to build a robust support system that not only helps to reduce \\nthe burden on affected individuals and famil ies, but also improves the overall well -being of \\nthe community and its ability to recover from unexpected events.   \\n \\n  \", metadata={'source': 'data/pdf-data/VOL.-6-ISSUE-1-MARCH-2024-105-115.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
